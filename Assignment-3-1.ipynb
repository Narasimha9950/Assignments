The bed was amazing and the pool and gym was also stacked with many machines and a great view while working out. The hotel staff is very very helpful, my wife forgot a pair of jeans and the mailed them back to us for free. I've never seen so much of an effort from any staff.Can't wait to stay again.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Nov 15 2009 \\tTop Notch!\\tEverything about Trump Chicago is stellar. From the the Bell Desk, to the Conceirge, to room service, to housekeeping. They make an effort to address patrons by name and are eager to please and make one's stay comfortable. The spa is fabulous as well. A special commendation to the Conceirge desk for making all my reservations without a hitch. Highly, highly recommend this hotel for your next visit to the Windy City.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 14 2009 \\tGREAT HOTEL CONCIERGE CLUELESS\\tStayed in November 2009, Hotel is FANTASTIC, Rooms are spacious, clean and very well eqipped. Restaurants were fine, but a little pricey. Enjoyed the Mile, staff very friendly and helpful except for the conceirge. Asked for Dinner recommendations, he said wait just a minute and let me find something for you. He stepped away and returned 20 minutes later as we were walking out the door. He literally shouted &quot; HEY YOU&quot; at us and waved a group of papers at us. I said never mind as we had given up on him. He mumbled something unintelligible and helped another guest. I don't mind waiting, but 20 minutes--come on!!! Overall we would definitely stay here again and would reccomend to all our other associates. Well done Mr. Trump.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nov 7 2009 \\tIt does not get better than this!\\tWe stayed at Trump Tower for Christmas last year apologies for the late review but now that we are getting nearer the festive season my children have been reminding me of the most wonderful christmas they have ever had! We travelled over from Ireland (my sister lives in Chicago) and were lucky to stay in a two bed suite which had the most fantastic view! Given the time of year and the amount of snow it was very magical. It was like our own very private penthouse. I believe well over 2000sq ft. The space, quality of the furnishings, bed linen, sound system..This hotel is a five star experience! On Christmas Day they had live reindeers outside the restaurant!! (true American style!)We used the gym and pool faciities every day and they are top notch. This is a wonderful hotel to stay in with young or teenage children. Great location for shopping and the ESPN sports bar which my kids loved.Chicago is a GREAT cityIf you have not stayed here yet ..go for it!! You will love it!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Nov 6 2009 \\tAwesome view of city/Navy Pier Fireworks\\tThis was our first trip back to the city and our first stay at the hotel. We were very impressed by our one bedroom suite and found the room to be very spacious, great view of the fireworks at Navy Pier from our room. We had a separate bath in the front entry of our room that also had a walk in shower. Great service by all the staff and their assistance on things was exceptional. I would definitely stay there again. The concierge made our dinner reservations one at our favorite restaurant - The Italian VIllage where we were treated to a brushetta appetizer from Jay the concierge at our hotel and the other was a recommendation from the concierge for Keefers - which has some of the best steaks and chicken we have had. Can't wait to return.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 5 2009 \\tGreat Service sadly was required too often.\\tI really wanted to like this hotel as much as I like the awesome sky scraper it is in. However I came away not really liking it as much as I had hoped I would. I was booked into an adjoining room which had surprisingly thin doors through which I could hear every word, cellphone conversation, music and alot of etc...all night long right through these thin doors. When I was checked into this room no one showed me how to work the complicated lights which were nice on dimmers and all but I had to call maintenence to come and put bulbs in some that were burned out and explain how to work them at all, costing me precious time. Long after midnight when I could no longer tolerate the conversations through the adjoing door situation, with it's surprisingly little sound barrier, service quickly responded to move me to another room. I moved into this second Spa Suite room and found the air machine as loud as I would expect to find at an interstate hightway motel but I was told that was due to it being some sort of purification system- which the hotel doesn't seem to need anyway. Maintenence was able to turn the loud air system off from remote, but again that took time for me to secure having first to allow a maintenence worker in the room, etc... On top of that desk staff explained to me that they leave the Bose Wave Radios on in unoccupied rooms so that staff will know if the room is unoccupied. All night long I could feel the thump of the bass and hear the music right through the wall which was so annoying! So many things seemed overly complicated at the hotel, from a shower in the health spa requiring reading glasses to program the computer running it, to tv's so high tech it took forever to change channels, to espresso makers that while nice did require a read up in the manual to figure out. The restaurant is very beautiful, but like the whole hotel, pretty cool to cold, spare, elegant decor. Service was great, food very good. The health spa is also pretty nice, and you could lift heavy weights or do cardio on alot of equipment if you were so inclined. The health club and pool have nice views, and are super clean and nice. The massage I had was extremely excellent but the manicure/pedicure was about the worst I have ever had and I re-did myself the next day. I stayed at the hotel in part because I was shopping for a residence in Chicago, and even scheduling to look at the residences in the building was more complicated than it needed to be. There is no lobby life at the Trump. Just a small sofa and chairs, not a social place at all. The lounge, Rebar, upstairs is the socializing area when it is open in the evenings and while it is posh like the rest of the place, it does not seem to offer much of a sense of friendliness to the solo traveller as I was. In total, Trump like the man comes off as complicated, egotistical, sophisticated, high tech, striving for greatness. Perhaps the best thing about staying in hotels that aim to be the best as Trump is obviously trying to do is that they do really care about your experience and will work to make it right as they did for me at Trump. I am grateful for their assistance, though I wish I hadn't of needed any of it.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nov 5 2009 \\tGorgeous room and great service\\tI stayed here with my boyfriend last weekend and we had a fabulous time. The room was impressive. It was modern and had a small kitchen area. The bathroom was spacious, with a separate tub and shower area, and the mirror above the sink had a TV in it. The view of the city was gorgeous and I loved the turn-down service. When we got back to our room at night, the lights were dimmed, there was soft music playing, our bed was turned down, and the TV showed an aquarium scene. The service was great. This was an overall relaxing and luxurious experience. The restaurant was pretty good and the location is perfect because you can just walk to Michigan Ave. for some shopping.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 25 2009 \\tWonderful staff and fantasitc service\\tGreetings from Saudi Arabia.My wife and I were in Chicago (Oct 2nd  Oct 19th) on Business (For me) and Pleasure (for her) and decided to stay at the Trump Hotel Chicago and we were truly surprised with the experience we had. We came in with very high expectation, which were not only met but very much surpassed in many instances. The hotel was beautiful in design as was the layout (I am not however in love with the design of the bathroom, especially the position of the toilet within it which is a bit of a let down for this class of facility). The hotel overall and the rooms in particular were in excellent condition, always clean and neat. What I really enjoyed and what I think made our experience standout was the staff. From the Housekeeping, Bellmen, Reception staff and especially the concierge who did their job exceptionally well. I would like to point out a member of the concierge team in particular I believe her name was Kathelena who was super in assisting us and especially my wife who had a lot of questions to ask on a daily basis. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and couple of 6 and 7 Star hotels as well. This was truly a great hotel. Especially if you can get it for good price. (I believe the rack rate is a bit high. But relative to other hotels in Chicago it didn't make it seem as bad)Looking forward to our next stay at the Trump Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 22 2009 \\tIt's the little things that make it so good\\tI stayed at the Trump for 5 nights in mid-July. I had seen the building when it was still under construction the year prior and had my eyes set on staying there on my next visit to Chicago. I was lucky to find a very reasonable rate on Hotels.com. The location is about as good as it gets: a short walk from the blue line coming in from the airport and equally close to a couple of other subway lines. The river is right there, Michigan Avenue around the corner. The Art Institute, Millenium Park, the Field Museum are all within easy walking distance.While I was surprised at the tight check-in area, the staff behind the desk was very courteous and efficient. (I had shipped my luggage beforehand and was happy to see that I was not charged for receiving it, whereas I had to pay $20 for shipping a small package to the Swissotel the year before.) The staff everywhere in the hotel was super nice, without attitude, and always available. Brunch on Sunday was expensive but sumptuous and I did not get any bad vibes when I was still hanging out after two hours, enjoying the views, reading my Sunday NYT, and having yet another nibble from the huge assortment of food.The room was superb: very spacious, a fabulous bed with immaculate linen, the impressive floor to ceiling windows, a BIG bathroom, and the overall quiet of the place. I highl recommend searching for a good rate and indulging in this 5-star experience.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 17 2009 \\tYou simply cannot do better\\tI don't stay at a lot of really top end hotels. For me it's mostly Hiltons etc. However, I've stayed at the Drake in Chicago, the St. Francis in San Francisco, The Four Seasons in Atlanta and The Ritz in Pasadena. In my experience nothing compares to the Trump.The hotel itself is not what you expect. The footprint is small so there's no grand entrance. However, the rooms are very very nicely appointed - I can honestly say that I have never felt sheets like that before. The location - a block off Michigan - is fantastic. However, what makes the Trump so much better than anywhere else is the service. With the exception of the St. Francis (which is awful) top hotels like those listed above always have great service. However, the Trump is in a class above the rest. I stayed two nights. Every single time that I encountered a hotel staffer they were open, friendly and helpful. Not once were they on the phone with a friend, chewing gum or acting like the clerks that I am used to seeing at Hilton class hotels. I went into the gift shop one morning and, as my foot entered the doorway the girl behind the counter said &quot;I have to go into her cell phone&quot; closed it and walked up to see how she could help me. Each time I entered or left the hotel the bellstaff were first class. Each time I called for assistance with whatever the phone was answered immediately and whatever I needed was done instantly. Call to order breakfast - fast, exactly right and tasty. I'm not saying that there aren't better hotels somewhere in the world. I'm sure that the super rich stay in places that I can only dream about. However, the super rich don't bother with Trip Advisor. This site is for people who don't always get pampered. And, for those of us who don't travel by Gulfstream, I simply cannot imagine how a hotel could be better than the Trump. If you get the chance - stay there.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Oct 14 2009 \\tThe Best Hotel in Chicago\\tAlthough we are from Chicago, we love to spend weekends when we can in downtown Chicago. After spending our time at the Trump, I feel like I just got home from a wonderful vacation without the jet lag! The attentive staff, elegant rooms and beautiful city/lake views were all part of the reasons that our stay was so wonderful. My only complaint was that we had to go back home! Looking forward to our next visit in November to this 5 star hotel.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Oct 11 2009 \\tfantastic view luxerious rooms\\tRequest a Chicago River view-nothing else like it in Chicago-front desk and valet seemed understaffed with our wait times , but all in all, the rooms are well-appointed and &quot;Las Vegas-like&quot;- unlike the older hotels, will be toasty warm on those windy winter nights.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 8 2009 \\tWorld-class!\\tFrom the door chime that replaces knocking ... to the softly scented bed linens ... to the TV in the bathroom mirror ... to the friendly, flawless service ... Trump is truly a five-star experience. All good hotels have decent beds, edible food, clean rooms. To me the mark of a five-star establishment is the service and attention to detail, and Trump excelled. Our welcome from valet, belstaff and front desk was very cordial -- we were upgraded to a room with the best view of the city I had ever seen, and I live here. On the 22nd story, we looked out out the river to the lake. Bridges, Wrigley Building, tour boats, traffic, pedestrians -- I liked it because it was high enough to not be too loud but low enough to be interesting. And the room was very quiet. You enter into a long hall that gives the room a sense of privacy and being set back. Beautiful, restful colors, greys and browns, contemporary without feeling harsh. Kitchenette with all high-end appliances and finishes, as you would expect. Disregard minibar! Bose sound system playing softly when we arrived. Bellman very friendly and informative. We had in-room dining the first night and the server set up four chairs for us and our guests. Only a 30-minute wait on a Friday night, and the food was outstanding. The room service person called up to make sure everything was ok, which we appreciated. I never sleep well in hotels, but the bed was very comfortable, as others have indicated. Check out the &quot;pillow menu&quot;! All-marble, spa-like bathroom with nice lighting. We breakfasted in the restaurant and the service, again, could not have been more solicitous. A nice feature is the &quot;juice of the day&quot; -- on this day, some kind of berry. Tasted very natural. Yum.Another observation we had: it doesn't feel snooty or faux-Continental. Families would be comfortable here, if they wanted to shell out for the &quot;Trump experience.&quot; So if you want a special getaway in Chicago -- I would absolutely recommend this hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 7 2009 \\tAbsolutely Sensational\\tI could not rave more about the Trump hotel in Chicago. The rooms (we just had the most basic one) were oversized and had amazing little extra features such as a great TV in the mirror, pillow menu, ipod speakers and more. The location was fabulous as we didn't have a car and could walk to trains, Navy Pier and everything else. The concierge staff were phenomenal and so helpful. The gym was also really well appointed. All in all a first class experience and one of the best I've ever had.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Oct 3 2009 \\tAn absolutely wonderful experience!!\\tThe superlatives are too numerous....the best way to put it is that in any future travels to Chicago, I would not want to stay anyplace but the Trump. It is first class all the way from location to staff, rooms, and cleanliness. Absolutely, I would recommend it to anyone!!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Sep 22 2009 \\tBest hotel experience I've ever had.\\tI stayed at the Trump Hotel in Chicago last weekend. The trip was a girls-only weekend to celebrate our 40th birthdays. The hotel exceeded my expectations, which were already high. It was an incredible experience.We booked the Grand Deluxe River View Suite (Unit 32) and were thrilled to get a room on the 27th floor (top floor of the hotel section of the building). The photos on the website do not do this suite justice. The overall effect of the high ceilings, huge space, floor-to-ceiling windows and incredible view was just stunning. When we first came into the room, we all ran around like a bunch of excited six-year-olds...checking out the bedroom, bathrooms, kitchen, etc. And just a few minutes after we checked in, we received a lovely &quot;happy birthday&quot; cake...very nice touch.Every part of the hotel was extremely clean, the staff was friendly (not the least bit condescending) and we loved the Terrace bar. (Just remember that you're paying for the view as well...the drinks are pricey.)There's no doubt that this is an expensive hotel, but if you want an &quot;experience&quot; vs. just a &quot;room,&quot; it's worth it. In fact, I'm checking out our travel budget already to see if my husband &amp; I can come back in December.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 15 2009 \\tWorth the splurge! Luxury redefined!\\tNot sure if it was the wall to wall windows with not one but two sets of drapes on electronic controls, the spectacular view, the television embedded in the bathroom mirror, the espresso machine, or the kitchen appliances but the WOW! factor was huge. We were still discovering features as we checked the drawers and closets on departure - all the little things that you don't know you need until you really do - clothes brushes, slippers, martini shaker, tape, scissors, staple remover - the list goes on!Just go and enjoy the luxury. The room was spacious, the amentities superb, and the service gracious. The restaurant on the 16th floor has an incredible view, good food, and personable staff. Probably the most expensive breakfast we have ever had (maybe topped by the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo) but we created a memory!Yes, it is expensive but The Trump sets the standard.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 14 2009 \\tWill stay here again\\tGreat location, beautiful view - paid extra for the river view and it was worth it. Enjoyed the cappucinno machine each morning. Very clean. Nightly turndown with slippers, robes, bottle of water and glass on the nightstand, music playing, aquarium scene on the TV when you arrive back after a long day on the town. Very large room. High ceilings make it feel even bigger. Will stay here again. Valet even had 2 bottles of water for us when we departed.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Sep 10 2009 \\tNice but little things added up......\\tWe stayed over Labor Day weekend and had a Spa King Room. First of all, the view was great, of Wrigley Tower and the Chicago River, just breathtaking. Now the little things that added up over the weekend stay:TV remote would not work and had to call down to front desk several times to get it checked. Not sure if anything was really done to fix the remote, one service guy rebooted the TV and admitted the TV system was not the right choice for a Trump hotel. The draperies are operated by a wall switch to open and close, but for some reason our drapery hooks had been pulled off the rod and therefore would not shut completely. Call down to the front desk again on several occasions. Next on Sunday morning we walked down our hall only to smell cigarette smoke on a non-smoking floor. Complained to front desk and they said they would check into it. Bed linens were not 500 count linens as stated. The bed was not as comfortable as again stated. Bathtub was large and used the bath but could not get the drain to open to let out the water. Had to call maintenance yet again. The staff is very nice and the concierge, George, went out of his way to find us a dinner reservation on Sunday when many restaurants are closed. The one he found was outstanding: Boka on Halsted. Excellent food and wine list. The Terrace bar is a great place to sit out and take in the great city views and the location is also close to Michigan Avenue. On the day of checkout, they even prepared a to go breakfast for us and told us the GM would be in touch, however have not heard from him. I have never stayed at a Trump but we usually stay at Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton's so we wanted to give this a chance. I would stay there again but I was disappointed. I completed the survey the hotel sends out but have yet to hear from GM.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 8 2009 \\tGreat Hotel!\\tWe were in Chicago for shopping and sightseeing and decided impulsively to stay overnight. Other places were booked full but found a suite at Trump Tower (about $700) for a King bed and pull out sofa bed. Lots of things about this hotel will make you giggle - they send up a plate of complimentary truffles, they have a pillow menu with varieties of complimentary pillows (soft, hard, body, scented), a water menu with exotic types of waters, full stocked liquor in fridge, great view of river, city had fireworks (only on Thurs &amp; Sat?). Lots of extra charges but you should try it once to splurge!Really, the only big annoyance was street noise - motorcycles and ambulances. And they could have had an outdoor pool.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Aug 30 2009 \\tLocation and View\\tWe chose this hotel because it is the new luxury property in town and overall we were pleased with our choice. Like many hotels in Chicago, the hotel is split up with a small lobby at ground level, restaurant and spa on 12 and 14, with rooms above these floors. This arrangement may bother some guests as the hotel has no real center or focal area, but this set up is a matter of personal taste. For us it was not really a problem. However, the lobby is small and the front desk was too close to the elevator lobby. The weekend we were at the hotel, it was very busy and getting around the front desk line was annoying and not what you want to see at a nice hotel. Compounding the problem was one of the three elevators to the guest rooms, spa, restaurant, and ballrooms was not working during most of our stay. Even with all three working, expect to wait sometimes. Our room was number 2304 and we would highly recommended the 04 line if you can get it. The view from this room was outstanding with the Wrigley building clock tower to the left, a straight on view out to the lake with no buildings in the way, and a great view of the Chicago River, as it bends right in front of you. All can be seen through floor to ceiling, wall to wall windows. The room was just over 900 square feet, including a long hallway. It is set up as a studio with a full kitchen that is really part of the bedroom. The overall look of the room is elegant and modern with muted colors. The large marble bathroom is very nice with separate shower and tub but no separate water closet. The TV in the bathroom mirror is very cool. There is a very nice large pool with a wall of windows overlooking the city and water. The gym also has great views and is a true gym so that a complete workout can be achieved. The locker room was very nice with steam and sauna but we felt it looked more like the locker room at a nice gym than at a five star hotel. We did not eat at the hotel, but there is a very cool looking restaurant and a nice outdoor bar area with a great view of the water and the city skyline. The location of the hotel is perfect. The loop area is just over the river, and the magnificent mile starts one block away. You are basically right in the middle of the main part of the city with almost every tourist site within walking distance.Overall this hotel is a good choice in a city with many great hotels. The hotel layout and design is a little quirky, the service was a little stretched the weekend we were there, but the large rooms, great views, and central location, make up for a few short comings.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Aug 29 2009 \\tThis hotel is fantastic. WOW\\tI stayed at the Trump a year ago and was fairly unimpressed- the staff at the time seemed to be still &quot;getting it together&quot;. WOW - what a difference a year makes. This stay was perfect! Jamie, the bellman, was outstanding. I did not like the original room we were assigned - nothing wrong with it - i just did not like the layout. Jamie called the front desk, got room numbers of three other rooms. He showed us the rooms, arranged for our luggage to be moved and brought us new keys.The in-room dining staff was great. My daughter has a severe peanut allergy and the in-room staff was excellent in removing all of the mini bar items - many of which contain nuts. The suite was wonderful - we had a lot of room for my husband, daughter and i to read and relax. Because we had a kitchen we were able to make breakfast in the suite and not eat out. Having a child with a food allergy makes it difficult to eat out and this room was perfect for us.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. The location is great - we walked everywhere - Michigan Avenue, the Art Institute, Millennium Park, the old Marshall Fields store. It was a great get away weekend!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 25 2009 \\tGreat Hotel\\tI recently stayed at the Trump Hotel in Chicago with a girlfriend for a couple days of shopping. The Trump Hotel was terrific and location couldn't be better. The staff was welcoming and made an effort to make us feel comfortable. The room was large and the kitchen was a nice touch although not used. The robes were wonderful and the beds comfortable. The only complaint was we had a dirty glass (not used by us) sitting on the kitchen counter during our entire stay. I am not sure why the housekeeping staff didn't notice it.We thought we were the only guests in the hotel as it was so quiet. We never heard a door close or any voices. Such a pleasure!We had a city view not overlooking the river that we had wanted but it didn't matter much.All in all, a great stay and would certainly recommend this hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 23 2009 \\tWonderful\\tCan I live here? I have to say this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. The rooms are large, we had a great view, the bed is fabulous! The bose sound system is great, fell asleep listening to smooth jazz. Bathroom was roomy with a nice shower, I didn't think I would use the tv in the mirror but it was cool and now I want one. We had a kitchenette that had everything, nicely stocked. The assortment of high end bottled water I could do with out. I had asked for an item to be in our room upon arrival which was not there, I had called down to the front desk and in less than 5 minutes they were at the door. That was the only snafu we had encountered. We visited Rebar which had nice views of the river. Drinks were good but pricey. Checked out the pool, nice, lots of kids. Next time I would love to try the spa services. We just didn't have time this trip. We enjoyed room service for breakfast, everything was cooked perfectly and arrived on time. They have doorbells outside each room that also lights up Do Not Disturb, no more door hangers. This is a pet friendly hotel, the in room menu offers food choices for your pet, I thought that was cute. Overall I have to say it was relaxing, surprisingly quiet, and comfortable. I highly recommend it.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 13 2009 \\tA Wonderful Stay\\tMy husband and I, along with our seventeen year old son and his friend, stayed in two rooms at the Trump Hotel during the Lollapalooza Festival. My husband loved the place. He says the building is magnificent. How can anyone find fault with this hotel? Everyone was so kind and helpful. No air of pretentiousness whatsoever.I especially loved the Nespresso machine. It is delicious with cream and a little more water. I am going to buy one when I get home.My little 7 lb. chihuahua/yorkie was greeted warmly whenever he peeked out of his carrier.The bathrobes are warm and cozy. I think Ivanka Trump's TV greeting was sweet and sincere.All I can say is that I have never been to such a great place at such a resonable price. Chicago is a cool city and we will be back.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 8 2009 \\tgreat room great location\\tjust got back from trump chicago- loved the room, booked on expedia, tv in bathroom, comfy bed, and huge room. Hated bathroom toilet, problem with flushing handle, my friends in another room had same jiggling problem. did not love hotel staff at check in- thought she was rude, and long waits for concierge, who often was less then helpful. also, how is it possible that the largest hotel in the city only had one uni-sex restroom in the lobby? Ridiculous. thought the bellman and outside staff great. all in all, loved my room, fitness room great, and would definitely recommend .\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 18 2009 \\tDonald got it right!\\tMy husband, our 2 teenage boys and myself stayed for 3 nights in July at the Trump Hotel. I looked at almost every hotel available in Chicago before deciding on The Trump. I wanted a memorable time with our family as this was our last trip together before our son leaves for college. I selected the Trump because of it's location, completely non-smoking policy and why not....it looks great on their website! What a fabulous choice... We loved it! We got upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite which allowed us to completely spread out. Amazingly beautiful room.... large bedroom with the most comfortable king bed, living room with tall windows allowing for great views, 2 bathrooms, complete kitchen with big refrigerator.....unbelievable. We took in everything the hotel has to offer. We ate at Sixteen every morning for breakfast. Perhaps it is a little pricy but not that bad. The food was good, service was excellent and the views from this16th floor restaurant were spectacular. We went to the fitness center a couple of times. Top-notch! It was a pleasure to work out with such nice amenities everywhere....individual tv screens on new cardio equipment, bottles of Trump water available, clean and bright room, lots of weight machines, and the views! We also went to the new outside Terrace Restaurant/Bar on the 16th floor. It was a beautiful night and we were lucky enough to get a table. The views of the Chicago River, Wrigley clock and Chicago buildings lit up at night were beautiful. Very memorable! During our stay, we walked everywhere....up and down Michigan Avenue, along the river, to the lakefront.....the hotel location is ideal. We took the Wendell boat ride which we would highly recommend and we went looking for the best pizza (thin crust). By the way, our vote goes to Ginos over Guiordanos! Overall, we loved staying at The Trump Hotel and we had a fantastic time in Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 18 2009 \\tGorgeous property a few service gaffs.\\tStayed here two nights for the first time in July. The hotel is squeezed on floors 14-25 between a bunch of empty floors (office spaces?) and a bunch of empty condo units above. Because of the downturn in the economy the property offers very very competitive rates for being a 5 Star hotel.The rooms are oversized and you'll want to request one on the river side. Understated and stunning interior design. Almost all the lighting is on dimmers and most can be controlled from a panel bedside. Complimentary WiFi in the rooms. The fabrics and choice of woods are really top notch. One thing that surprised me was the bathroom amenities. While oversized, they are rather generic in cheaper plastic bottles and private labeled with Trump. I left them. Normally if they were anything good, such as Bulgari, L'Occitane from the Peninsula or Ritz Carlton, they would have all gone home with me. Not here. They weren't bad amenities, just rather plain and generic. Here's the service gaffs, which I'll blame on the housekeeper. The bathroom scale didn't work. Why? The battery was dead. The small tv built into the bathroom mirror was inoperable. Why? The tv hadn't been scanned to set up the channels. The light on the desk didn't work. Why? The lamp was defective and they had to change it out.Who knows maybe I was the first guest ever in the room, but had the chambe maid done a simple check these things could have been worked out before a guest arrival. Oh well.It's a stunning hotel. The gym and spa occupies an entire floor. I have been in some of the nicest hotels in the world and the gym here is one of the nicest I have encountered. I did not use the spa. Extraordinary rates and I wasn't going to pop for the cost without seeing some reviews of their services.The food service was good, not great, certainly at the top of the Chicago market. I would encourage people to eat elsewhere. Chicago is known for its famous restaurants such as NOMI, Alinea, Charlie Trotter's etc. There's no reason to pay Michelin style prices for common food. Get out in the city and enjoy the food. The bedding and pillows are amazing. One of the nicest beds ever, they really do it right and if you're looking for a great nights sleep this is it. The room also had a semi stocks kitchen almost like a little time share with a two burner cooktop, sub zero refridgerator, crystal barware, etc. The had a large well stocked mini bar complete with Trump chocolate bars. You'll also find Ivanka's jewelry line hawked in a magazine and postcards in the desk. It's an interesting experience. This is the time to visit this hotel before the economy strengthens and they raise their prices, which I assure you will happen as occupancies build.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 15 2009 \\tWow!\\tIf you have the money, this is definitely the place to stay in downtown Chicago, right on the river. Everything was first class and priced accordingly. Maybe the best breakfast I've ever had, but cost including tip was $80.00.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 13 2009 \\tWonderful hotel take my word for it!\\tMy wife and I went to Chicago for the past weekend and we chose the Trump for the most part because of the great reviews on this site. I can tell you that the reviews were completely accurate and this hotel is really something else. From the hand towels on check in to the televsion in the centre of the bathroom mirror to the gorgeous huge hotel room, it was a wonderful weekend in luxury! Don't forget the location which is actually a block or so away from Michigan Avenue, which is actually perfect because you are right in the middle of everything, but a touch away so that you don't hear the noise. I was most impressed by the fact that the manager took the time to comment on each review, again all class! I just can't see how you can be dissappointed!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 10 2009 \\tGreat hotel but pricey\\tWe stayed for a weekend in March when some of the hotel was still under construction. The lobby was very nice, modern and clean. The location was great to visit the magnicificant mile and being right on the river we had a great view of the lakeshore. The rooms were comfortable with great mattresses and the option of your choice of pillows. The gym was nice and they offer your headphones to use on the tv's that are on the fitness equipment. Though the views were of a building next door that was pretty much an eye sore. The coffee in the lobby was amazing, being a coffee snob it was a nice detail for them to include. The showers were truely bizarre though, in order to turn the shower on you had to get into the bath tub that was next to it so you didn't get sprayed with cold water when it turned on. Wish I had a picture of it, because it's hard to describe but let's just say it was a major design problem. Another odd thing was the Bling water in the room, now I know that people like bottled water but do I need a $25 bottle of water with Swarovski crystals on it?! We chose to use the valet while we were there for $45 per night, which we would probably not do again as the self park is very close by. We didn't eat at the restaurant in the hotel, but took a tour and it was very nice. We were recently in Chicago again and it looks like the gardens next to the hotel are almost done, which will add a nice accent to the hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jul 7 2009 \\tGreat Hotel - Service Lacking\\tThe new Trump International Hotel and Towers in Chicago is a beautiful hotel with a great location, but the service definitely has room for improvement. The room was very spacious and nicely decorated, with a very nice bathroom (although the TV in the mirror seems pretty useless and takes away from the surface of the mirror you can actually use). There was also a water menu in the room with several overpriced bottles of water which were kind of fun to look at, but not sure who would actually want tot drink them. The spa and pool area is very nice but there seems to be something missing from the pool area; maybe some plants or an attendant or a drink menu; seems kind of remote and impersonal.The restaurant Sixteen offered an impressive and delicious brunch buffet on Sunday and the views were amazing. Location is excellent and just a quick walk south to Millennium Park or one block east to Magnificent Mile. I wouldnt hesitate staying here again for the right price, but dont expect the kind of service you would receive form the Four Seasons or peninsula (and the rates reflect this).\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jul 1 2009 \\tGreat Hotel! 5* Service! Great Location and Views!\\tWe just got back from 3 nights at the Trump Hotel in Chicago. We got one of their summer specials - stay 2 nights get the 3rd night free. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which was enormous and big enough for all 4 of us. Best luxury in the room - the TV located INSIDE the bathroom mirror! Floor to ceiling windows and a fireplace plus a kitchen (stocked with all sorts of drinks and snacks if you want to pay their prices - also they will grocery shop and stock it for you with your favorites if you want). If you are traveling with kids ask for the Trump Kids extras - bathrobes, slippers for kids, backpack, business cards with the kids names printed on them, cookie &amp; milk upon arrival (cookie plate had their names spelled out in chocolate - I wont lie to you this was their favorite part about the trip!), an X-box and age appropriate games. It was my husbands birthday and there was a nice cake in the room upon arrival too. We felt so pampered! Every staff member was amazing and helpful. The hotel location is great - right next to the Wrigley building, the views were awesome - try to get an east facing room with views of the lake. The pick up stop for the Chicago trolley was just a block away. Cab rides to the tourist locations (Sears Tower, Field Museum, Ditkas Restaurant) were $10 each or less. You can walk to the Navy Pier but its a long walk - about a mile - and it was 99 degrees when we were there so we took a cab. There is also a free trolley to the Navy Pier about 2 blocks away. The pool has great views, and the locker rooms have a steam and sauna, showers etc. They were just finishing the outside touches and furnishing the upstairs condos (the lower floors are a hotel, the rest of the building are condos) but there was no noise - earlier reviews talked about the construction noise but that is over. We didnt eat at the restaurant (so many great ones nearby) but the views of the river and lake front were outstanding. We didnt use the Fitness Center (no charge) but the views were amazine - looking out over the river and huge - lots of machines. The service was better than I have ever experienced.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 25 2009 \\tAmazing luxury experience in the heart of Chicago\\tWe're from Chicago, and we had received a gift certificate to the hotel for Christmas. We decided to spend the night after an event we were scheduled to attend. The lowest class of room was sold out, so we bumped up the level a bit. When we arrived, we were unexpectedly upgraded to a gorgeous, spacious suite with an amazing master suite, 2 bathrooms, a full kitchen, and a living room. The room was, in a word, glorious. Every last detail was addressed, and we thought that the experience was amazing. We had friends come over for appetizers and champagne prior to the event, and we felt like we were entertaining in our own home. We'd move in if we could, river view and all. Great experience, and when we want to splurge, we'll definitely come here again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 23 2009 \\tNot a 5 star property by a longshot\\tThe Trump hotel would have easily earned 4 stars from me were it not for some really annoying faux pas. Note: these wouldn't be such a big deal if not for Trump's endless windbaggery about how he does things &quot;The Best&quot;, &quot;The Greatest&quot;, &quot;The Be All and End All&quot;. When you make those kinds of boasts, Mr. Trump, that's what I expect of your organization. I am a low-key guest who doesn't demand much. When a hotel can't even deliver on the basics? They're FIRED.First the good things:- Rooms are enormous w/fantastic views- I only paid $199 for the room ($399 seems a bit of a stretch for the location, but the property is new, clean, pristine &amp; a value at $199)Now for the less-than-good things. For $199, they're fine. For being a purported 5-star property? They are a joke.- No one told us that you needed to use your room key in order to operate the elevator, so we stood around looking like village idiots for several minutes, punching the buttons &amp; wondering what the malfunction was until another guest explained them to us.- No internet in the room! I called the concierge about this &amp; was told this was an issue they have w/AT&amp;T, specifically. Aren't they the largest wireless network in the U.S?. So surfing for local attractions on my iphone wasn't possible w/o heading for the business center three floors down (no thanks).- The pretentious &quot;Water Menu&quot; in the room. I can't figure out if Trump &amp; Co. were serious about this, or if it was put there for comic relief. Truly, it was one of the most pretentious and faux-classy (or &quot;klassy&quot;) things I've ever seen. Evian or Fiji is just fine, Mr. Trump. We don't need to guzzle, &quot;a truly brilliant water whose time has come.&quot; (Seriously, that's an actual quote. We were dying!)- Large TV in room was perfect for late night tv watching, although the In-House programming menu didn't match what was actually playing. It might say that a certain movie was playing on HBO at 10:00 PM, but when you turned to that channel, it was something completely different. After channel surfing a bit, we decided to give it up turn in early. - As we were drifting off to sleep at around 11:30 PM, the phone rang. In a pitch black hotel room with 3 phones, you can imagine how disconcerting - and LOUD - that would be. I groped around for the phone (which was on the other side of the bed), trying not to wake my 13 year old niece, but then the ringing stopped. Ok - whew. That must have been a fluke, right? I went back to bed, heart still racing a bit from the shock. 10 minutes later, right as I was beginning to relax, it rang again! This time i was concerned. I don't even get late-night phone calls at home, much less when I'm at a hotel for the night. Something must be wrong. So, I turned on the light, woke up my niece, answered the phone &amp; heard, &quot;Yeah - I'd like to order a small pizza.&quot; Shocked &amp; dazed, I told the caller he had the wrong #. &quot;Is this [--]?&quot; he askedWhy, yes - it was. Apparently he had dialed the main switchboard # and been put through to OUR ROOM at 11:45 PM. Lovely.Furious, I called the switchboard &amp; asked them to hold all calls for our room until 7:00 AM the following morning. - When I mentioned this at checkout, I could tell by the look on the woman's face that she was mortified. She admitted that it was essentially the hotel's fault, as there were a lot of people @ the hotel w/my last name &amp; the call probably got passed through to us accidentally. This upset me. What kind of ineptitude managed that feat 2x in a row? We had only one expense while we were @ the hotel: A $31 breakfast (for coffee &amp; a bagel w/lox). I would have thought that she would have comped us for our trouble. Nope! Instead she apologized and then smiled and asked, &quot;But you got enough sleep, right?&quot; Uh, that's not the point. The inmates @ San Quentin probably get enough sleep every night, too. I could have slept more peacefully at home. And, next time I will, or else I'll spend the extra $150 and head for the Peninsula or IV Seasons, where I know their promises of &quot;World Class&quot; service are more than just hot air &amp; $25 bottles of drinking water. (LOL - still giggling at that one.)\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 21 2009 \\tInconsistent Service\\tMy wife and I recently spent two nights at Trump while celebrating her 40th birthday. We both came away from our stay with mixed emotions. On the plus side, the hotel has a great location as it's situated on the river and only a short walk to the Mag Mile, Millennium Park, etc. Our room was aesthetically appealing and quite comfortable, particularly the bathroom, which had a large shower and bath area. In addition, we were very satisfied with our spa service (Soul to Soul), though it was a tad bit expensive.While the hotel has a lot going for it, there were too many minor irritations that left us with a negative impression. I'll start with the $50/night valet parking that others have mentioned in their reviews. This seems outrageous to me. Classic two part pricing where you get focused on the cost of the room and you end up paying a lot more because of other services. It's probably worth the inconvenience to park across the street! On the topic of getting nicked for other services, we were erroneously charged for mini bar items that we never consumed (they did remove this fee at check out). Also, while this is probably unique to our stay and not likely replicated by you, a maintenance person barged into our room soon after we had arrived looking for a video game, or some such nonsense, that he thought someone had left behind (turns out he was wrong). He rang the bell once and was in the room rummaging around. Good thing we had just arrived and were checking out the room, otherwise it could have been really awkward! Doesn't anybody knock anymore.As I mentioned at the onset, we were staying at the hotel celebrating a birthday. The staff sent a bottle of champaign, which was a very nice touch, but the card wished us well on our wedding anniversary. While the message was a bit off, we drank the bottle of champaign anyway, thank you very much.Finally, our neighbors decided to crank up their stereo at 3:00am on the last night of our stay. Maybe those Bose systems with the Ipod adapter are not such a great idea after all.Decide for yourselves, but for my money, I'll take Four Seasons any day of the week. Respect.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 18 2009 \\tFantastic hotel on the Michigan river right in the middle of downtown.\\tThe Trump was perfect. My wife and I were on our honeymoon and this was a fantastic final hotel in our 4-week US road trip honeymoon. They upgraded us two levels and we had a gigantic (I think 800+ sq ft) room with a Lake view. It had a kitchenette (the only thing missing was a oven) which was perfect since I have food allergies and prefer to eat food I cook since I can be positive what it did and did not contain or come in contact with. Finally, the bathroom was amazing. A giant soaking tub that fit two, a great shower and a bathroom mirror that had a TV in it. The trump is right next to the South end of the Magnificent Mile of shops on Michigan Avenue. My wife and I walked that one afternoon on the way to a Cubs game at Wrigley. And with that said, the concierge was able to get us great seats at a reasonable price to a sold out Sunday afternoon game. I was not sure we would get the tickets, but not only did he find some, they were in the fifth row down the third base line. Perfect!The only downside to the hotel was the ridiculous charges for room service and valet parking. A six-pack of Sam Adams beer was $30 not including the room service delivery charge of $4. Seriously, it is a $8 six-pack of beer, and $4 to deliver to the room, WTF? And the valet parking was ~$50/night. That is not a typo $50/night! Yet at the same time, it was our honeymoon, so the cost didn't really matter, even if they were annoying.The Trump is over the top and exactly what one would expect for the $400+/night the rooms cost. Yet even though expensive, I think it was worth it since the rooms were more than twice the size of rooms we were in prior hotels on our trip. Also, it had the kitchenette and fantastic bathroom with a great view of the Lake. Overall, I'd highly recommend this hotel to others.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 11 2009 \\tBest Hotel in Chicago one of the best in the world\\tWithout doubt the best hotel in Chicago and one of the best hotels in the world. My wife and I were in Chicago to visit our son and decided to stay in the Trump as we had stayed in the Peninsula and Four Seasons in previous years. Our city view room was exceptional and larger than most suites that I have stayed in. There was a kitchen in our room which is vital for people living away from home for two weeks. It was ideal to have the option to eat out or just to relax in our room and have something light to eat.The gym facilities are amazing. The view from the gym is worth going there alone but when I did pretend to work out my treadmill had its own fan and iPod docking station. Simple idea but something that is not in very many gyms. Of course it was spotless and appeared to have equipment for a serious workout or a guy like me just going through the motions.When we ate breakfast at 16 (the restaurant within the hotel) we received personlized attention and exceptional service from our server (he showed us where the best views were in the foyer so that we could take better pictures of the Chicago skyline for our family to see). I normally don't eat breakfast but 16 made me break that rule every day throughout my stay.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. It is very well priced for the service and quality of hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jun 11 2009 \\tExcellent Hotel with Outstanding Service - Especailly for kids\\tWe made a short (3 night) trip to Chicago and stayed at the Trump International Hotel with our 11 month old baby. From the very first minute when we stoppe the car at the Valet, we were made very welcome and everybody was extremely helpful and courteous. Upon check-in our baby boy received a little stuffed cow which he really liked and is now part of his stuffed animal collection he likes to fall asleep with. There was a glass of milk and a cookie waiting in the room for him as well as a real baby crib with proper mattress and not just a &quot;Pack &amp; Play&quot;. I have to admit, the Trump Organization has figured it out: &quot;Happy Baby makes Happy Parents&quot;! Everybody knew our babyboys name and everybody looked extremely well after him which gave us even some time to relax while eating.The food in &quot;Sixteen&quot; is very good and we definately enjoyed a great Sunday Brunch. Agian, plenty to chose from for our baby as well. The Spa is excellent and once again, everywhere within the hotel we went we felt very welcome and were treated with courtesy and respect.Overall an EXCELLENT experience and we will be back.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 3 2009 \\tA luxurious place to sleep and indulge\\tMy Mom and I stayed here for Mother's Day. The King City View Room was HUGE and extremely comfortable and inviting, very warm. The beds were excellent. The bathtub was amazing with well designed hardware. The color palette was beautiful. I would highly reccomend the pool and fitness center. Some of the room service and spa menu items are outrageously expensive, even comical sometimes, but there was a great variety on the menu, which is great for people with special diets, or just someone feeling like a peanut butter banana panini is a more interesting choice for breakfast then your ususal coffee, muffin, eggs bacon...\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 1 2009 \\tGood but not great\\tPlus points: Checkin was quick and friendly. Hot towel at the checkin counter a nice touch. Room is a nice size, all amenities very good. Bathroom is nice - I actually like the 'wet' area for the bath + shower. Toiletries etc. are own brand but seem pretty good. The hotel is also in a good location suitable for business or pleasure - near the loop and Michigan avenue. Having the kitchenette in the room is good too (but read the negative) - housekeeping washed up the cup/saucer/bowl/measuring-cup I left out. They also supply an electric kettle as well as the nespresso machine.Negative points: housekeeping is a bit random, on the one evening I was in the room they came round to do the turndown service at about 9pm. It would be better if they could ask for a preferred time and schedule to those times.Also I bought some milk+cereal to have a simple breakfast in the room. Housekeeping disposed of the milk on my second to last night. Maybe I left it out, but it would have been nice to have a note at the very least about why they removed it. The fridge is also full of the usual overpriced minibar junk. I'd recommend making a specific point of confirming with housekeeping they aren't going to throw anything away. Also a point for our UK visitors - no teapot or coffee jug, but you can use the measuring cup.Compared with the Peninsula and the 4 Seasons it's close but not quite as good.-- Harry\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 27 2009 \\tNice Hotel\\tMy family of four(kids 8&amp;11) stayed for two nights over the Memorial day weekend. We had a Deluxe King City View room on the 26th floor. We booked through the hotel and got a special rate of $199 a night. The regular rate is $399 a night. PROS: The hotel is in a great location. My family was able to walk to all of the local attractions. Plenty of restaurants close by. Hotel staff were very courteous when we arrived. The room was nice. We had a great view of the sunset. Plenty of room for four people. Stocked mini-bar but it was expensive. There was a 7/11 about a block away so we bought our snacks there. Also a Dunkin Donuts right across the street. Bathroom was excellent. Kids loved the TV in the mirror. The bathrobes were super soft. They even had robes for the kids. Beds were comfortable. About an hour after we checked in they brought up cookies and milk for the kids. Kids loved the pool but said the water was cold. CONS: When we made our reservations we requested for our room to be ready at 2:00 pm. When we arrived they said the room was cleaned but a supervisor needed to check it first. We ended up having to wait in the lobby for an hour until they finally checked us in. When we made our reservations they asked for our kids ages and names so they could have a &quot;goodie pack&quot; ready for them. When we checked in they didn't give us anything. After dinner we called the front desk and asked about the kids pack. They sent up a small mesh backpack with crayons and a coloring book. On their website they promise a lot more than that. Maybe because it was Memorial Day weekend they didn't have the time. The only complaints I had with the room was the sliding bathroom door. I would have preferred a bathroom door that gives you a little more privacy. The sliding glass door, with no lock, doesn't work for me. We never did have enough towels. The first morning we took our showers we noticed we only had two bath towels and a bigger towel that was probably a pool towel. We told the front desk when we went out that day we needed at least four bath towels. The maid came and did the room and still only left two bath towels. We had to call maintenance because the TV wouldn't turn on. The maintenance guy came right away. Turns out the maid knocked the power cord loose when she was dusting. The day we checked out the valet brought the wrong car from the parking lot. We had to wait 15 minutes for them to get the right car. They did give us some bottles of water while we waited. OVERALL: I would go back to the Trump if I got the promotion rate of 199 a night. I wouldn't pay the normal rate though. For that price I would expect everything to be flawless. It was a very nice place but it wasn't perfect. I give it a 4 out of 5.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 26 2009 \\tTrump Towers above the rest - with one exception\\tWe enjoyed our stay at the Trump over Memorial Day weekend with one notable exception, which I will get into later. Our arrival was an indication of things to come  the valet took the car and let me know it could be delivered with :10 notice whenever I wished. We recognized the bell captain Emanuel from his days at The Sofitel where he took good care of us. Our bellman, Shawn, was friendly, polite and very knowledgeable. Shawn waited while I checked in and the sons were given their Trump Kids amenity. The front desk staff was professional, yet it seemed to throw them a curve when I made a request to change my room  yet remain in the same room-type category.We had reserved a King Suite with a city view and reservations had assigned us to a room ending in 28 which I knew to be facing the IBM Plaza  something I didnt want  so I requested to be moved to a room ending in 02 which had a commanding view of River North. One may access the floorplans in advance of the stay at: www.trumpchicagohotel.com/Accommodations/interactive_floor_plans.aspThe request was accommodated and Shawn showed us to our room and explained everything from the pushbutton Do Not Disturb sign to the espresso machine (which makes really awful espresso, I must say). He took his time and made us feel like VIPs. Our suite was spacious and comfortable, decorated in muted grays and the furniture is some kind of dark wood. The view was mostly north along Wabash with a small view of Lake Michigan and the Hancock as well. It was nice to have two flat-panel HD televisions in the suite with a DVD player for each. It was also nice to have two full baths! The linens were crisp and comfortable. My wife though the bed was a bit soft, but it was fine for me. Our pillow menu requests were honored accurately and promptly, even though we had requested a different room upon check-in. This turned out to be the one thing that housekeeping got right. After getting settled, we went straight to the pool, which has a commanding view east down the Chicago River to Lake Michigan. Unfortunately, there was no telephone in the pool for us to order a cocktail, so I had to walk out to the spa area to do so. It took a half-hour to deliver the drinks which, we found later, was the exception rather than the rule. The server had also bought the milk and cookies amenity for our boys and wondered if we would prefer that he deliver to our room instead. We did prefer that, and he took care of it. It was really a nice touch  each boys name was written on the plate in chocolate and they told us later it was the best cookie they ever had!We used in-room dining for one breakfast and a dinner. I was impressed that Trump stocks Spiegelau crystal in the kitchen. The full complement of plates, silver and kitchen tools were most welcome. In-room delivery time was accurate to the minute on both occasions. The graciousness and competency of the server was most welcome and the quality of the food simply marvelous. Trump clearly has its room-service down. My wife forgot to include a bottle of wine with the dinner and it was delivered within :05 minutes of our order. It was wonderful to have a refrigerator in the room, and we brought a bottle of bubbly for us, sodas and juices for the kids and had a place to stow our deep-dish pizza leftovers!Chef concierge Joseph Coston was helpful with CTA bus information and dining options and concierge Kathleen Zubroski had scored excellent Mary Poppins tickets for us in advance of our arrival. The Trump Concierge staff is the best Ive seen in Chicago and weve stayed at all of the luxury hotels with the exception of the Park Hyatt.My spa treatment was, in a word, transformational. I can highly recommend therapist Jon Meltzer. The amenities in the spa are first-class and the locker/shower facilities are the finest Ive seen. It was neat to be able to choose an aromatherapy for the steam room from a tray of three options. The Kohler multi-head shower with music and lighting in the mens locker room is especially wonderful. Chilled, bottled water was in abundance as were towels and grooming materials. I didnt use the Sauna. This would have been a perfect stay had it not been for ongoing issues with Housekeeping:#1) I asked Housekeeping for a larger bathrobe and slippers as the standard robe and slippers dont fit me. I was told they would be delivered promptly, but they were not. I ended up having to get a larger robber from the Spa locker room and never did find slippers that fit. #2) On our first night in the room, the turn-down staff showed up at 5pm, just after we had returned from the pool. We informed the person that we didnt want any turn-down service during our stay until 6:30pm at the earliest. At 6:00 pm  turn-down comes to the door again! We send them away again. At 6:30, when we are leaving for Mary Poppins, they arrive for service. We ask them to be sure to leave extra pillows and blankets for the boys on the sofabed. We arrive back from the show at 10:30 pm to find one pillow and one blanket on the sofabed. To their credit, within :10 minutes we had the extras we had requested. #3) On our second night, turn-down shows up AGAIN at 5pm and we tell them AGAIN no service earlier than 6:30pm. AGAIN, another knock on the door at 6pm. We ask them to come back at 6:30 when we plan to leave and make clear that the extra pillow and blanket we had saved from the previous night is to be used AGAIN. We arrive back at the hotel from dinner at 8:30pm to find one pillow and one blanket on the sofabed. AGAIN we must call for additional pillow and blanket. #4) On our third and final evening in the hotel, we were tired from a day of Lincoln Park Zoo and shopping so we went to our room at 3:45 to find the housekeeping staff just starting to service the room. OK  we decided to go to Rebar for a drink, and enjoyed another nice view of the river. They served us a small tray of nibbling items including my fave - pitted kalamata olives. The sushi menu looked good  and expensive  but we only wanted a drink and the view. We returned to our room at 4:30 and were disappointed to find housekeeping still there. This time, we remained in our room to ensure that an extra pillow and blanket were delivered and the sofabed was made up. And guess what  at 5pm turn-down knocked on the door AGAIN. This is a five-star hotel for crying out loud. They are supposed to note these kinds of things after being told once. I didnt get a chance to register any complaint with the management before we checked out because we had a schedule to keep. However, I was able to note the issues on the follow up guest survey I received via email the day after checkout. Bottom line  we would stay at the Trump again as 95% of the stay was really great. You cannot beat the location and, with the exception of Housekeeping, staff members were responsive and gracious.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'May 25 2009 \\tFabulous\\tMy husband and I just returned from a 3 night stay in the Trump Hotel. We stayed in one of the Spa rooms on the 14th floor. This was actually perfect for us, we just had to walk up a flight of steps to use the health club, pool, etc. Rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable, bathrooms are wonderfully large. We had a great non-refundable rate of $199 which made it an even better stay....I would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat. The staff and service were perfect. The location is in the middle of everything.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'May 18 2009 \\tGreat hotel\\tMy wife and I really enjoyed our stay there. The room was spacious and well planned with an Nespresso coffee machine in the room. Large bathroom and very comfortable. Normally upon arrival in the room we usually clean up and bolt out of the room but we were compelled to just hang out in the room and relax with a glass of wine. Room service was right on time and with no lingering looks from the person that brought the meal up. Definitely on my list for a return visit.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"May 12 2009 \\t5 stars - zero disappointment\\tAll I can say is wow. We stay at hotels a lot. And every time I've stayed at a luxury hotel in the past, I've been disappointed. The Trump changed all that. At $199 a night on a special Travelzoo deal, I decided to give the Trump a try and indulge a little for a Mother's Day stay with my kids. I was impressed from the moment we arrived. We valet parked and our bags were brought inside for a smooth check in - every staff member addressed us by name. Kids were given backpacks with cotton candy and coloring books. Bellman brought us to our room; as we got off the elevator, I could tell we were headed to the river side of the property. I was so surprised &amp; pleased to see we had been upgraded to a larger, partial river view room. The room was kind of wedge shaped so the panoramic views from the floor to ceiling windows were amazing. Furnishings were in a muted purple with taupes and grays and looked just like the pictures on the website. I had ordered some amenities (gourmet popcorn, candy jar and chocolate covered strawberries) ahead of time to surprise my kids, and all were in the room just like I had requested. A few minutes after we arrived at our room, the bellman returned with little stuffed animals (pink and blue cows with a Trump Kids logo) for each of the kids - told me they had inadvertantly been left out of their backpacks at check in ( I was later told that the kids names and ages hadn't been updated into my profile- we only booked one day prior.) I asked about robes and slippers for the kids, and housekeeping brought them a few minutes later. We opted to relax and order a room service lunch - kids had a burger &amp; fries and grilled cheese with tomato soup. I got prosciutto di parma with buffalo mozzarella on grilled baguette. Food was amazing and presented with real silverware and a fresh orchid. The server asked if we would be dining at Sixteen later; I told him I thought the experience would likely be lost on the kids, but he mentioned that anything on the kids room service menu could be ordered at the restaurant - I'll keep this in mind for next time. As it stood, we kept out reservations at Harry Caray's - an easy 2 block walk from the hotel. After lunch, we checked out the pool. You have to sign in at the spa on the 14th floor to use the pool, but the staff was very helpful and personally escorted us to the locker rooms. Kids enjoyed a nice swim while I relaxed and enjoyed the views of the Chicago River &amp; Lake Michigan. Headed back to our room to get ready for dinner and found housekeeping was already there to turn down the bed. They don't leave wrapped chocolates on the pillow, rather a lovely glass tray of assorted chocolates and a gumdrop my kids fought over. Before swimming, we had asked for a game console, and we found a Playstation 3 and a few games had been delivered while we were out. Kids had a little trouble with the controllers, but maintenance came up quickly and brought the connection cable we were missing. Kids enjoyed a Wall-e game while I got ready. When we came back from dinner, we found the sofa bed had been made up just like we requested at check-in. What we did not find were cookies for this kids, which I thought were part of the Trump Kids amenities. A quick phone call to the front desk, and a few minutes later, in room dining brought up 2 large chocolate chunk cookies with glasses of milk. Kids couldn't even finish them. After the kids fell asleep, I took a bath - the bathroom is lovely, with a TV in the mirror as well as an adjoining tub and shower. Tub was deep and long with a waterfall faucet and I was able to indulge and enjoy a long bath - I am 5' 10&quot; and the tub was quite comfortable - this is rare for me. The shower has a rainfall head as well as a separate handheld shower massage. Robes for adults were in the bathroom and a digital scale and hair dryer were available as well. Bath amenities were very ample size - much larger than most hotels. Bed was so comfy - I loved the pillows but there was a pillow menu if you wanted something different. Kids couldn't wait to wake me up and open the curtains - all controlled with convenient wall switches. The view was even more impressive than the day before. We ordered room service for breakfast - my breakfast would have served all 3 of us if my kids weren't so picky. I ordered a &quot;Heart Healthy&quot; combination for $27 which included choice of juices (from orange to cherry pomegranate,) a blueberry muffin with assorted jams &amp; honey, a large fruit plate with 4 kinds of berries, cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple and oranges, a huge bowl of Swiss Mueslix with pecan halves, slivered almonds, chopped apple and dried apricot, and coffee, tea or skim milk. I didn't eat half of it - just so much food. Kids pancakes and french toast were $9 each but served with more fresh berries. We had time for another swim before checking out and wished we had booked more than one night. It was such an enjoyable stay. Had a few glitches at check out - our breakfast charges weren't on the bill and the website had promised business cards for the kids with their names printed on them. We had lunch and shopping planned so we agreed to store our bags and come back later to get the kids' cards and my corrected bill. Was so pleased to find out the valet would keep our car until 5PM, included in the $52 daily rate from when we checked in - we took full advantage. I was handed an envelope when we got back - they recognized us. I just assumed the envelope had the cards for the kids and my bill, but once home found only the cards. I'm sure they sorted the bill out and if I don't get a copy in the mail, I'll give them a call and ask. Our stay was not seamless; but whenever things didn't go quite right, staff went above and beyond to rectify matters, and were always apologetic and cordial. What I loved most about the Trump was the lack of pretentiousness. As far as I could see, all the guests were treated well and addressed by name. Even bell staff in the elevator greeted us and asked us how we were enjoying our stay. I felt like we were being welcomed back rather than staying there for the first time. It was really a delightful experience. This is what a luxury hotel should be - friendly, professional staff, gorgeous rooms, great food and perfect location. This hotel is a real gem and we can't wait to go back.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 10 2009 \\tAmazing Five Star Service/rooms/amenitites\\tAs a treat, my husband and I decided to stay here for the night preceeding Mother's day. We live in the suburbs of Chicago but enjoy overnighting in the city about 3 times a year. My children and cousin accompanied us just to check out the rooms but they were not staying overnight. Arrival:serivce was excellent. We valet parked the car, our bags were taken by the bellman, and our names were obviously placed into the computer system because less than a minute later, when we were checking in, the front desk staff called me by name. We were provided four lavender scented hot towels, and though my children would not be staying, *(and I told the front desk this,) the staff, nevertheless, gave my two children each a backpack containing cotton candy, a stuffed animal and crayons/coloring book.So very nice!Room:Our bellman took us to our room on the 17th floor. Each room has a doorbell and a light as its &quot;do not disturb&quot; system. We stayed in a standard King and got an unbelievable $199 deal. Our room was the largest standard room I'd ever been in (and we've stayed at luxury five star Ritz, Four seasons, etc..); this room was about 600 sq. feet. Regular rate for this room is $475. The room was done in muted mauve and earth tones. It was lovely and modern/tasteful. It had a velvet sofa, table, chair desk; not in any way cramped. Closet space was ample with a comp. umbrella. extra shopping bags as necessary. The bathroom located next to the front door contained a wet area for shower/soaker tub and a tv was built into the mirror.Back in the hall: along one very long wall was a high end galley kitchen with 2 burner meile cooktop, microwave, diswasher, fully stocked, euro cabinets with granite, a large minibar and a espresso maker which makes espresso by inserting small packets of coffee (I can't recall the name for this type of system). Used it in the am. Great coffee and easy to use! Room had two bathrobes, two sets of slippers, all toiletries necesssary (just like Ritz, etc.).This was the most beautiful and comfortable bed I've slept in. I wanted to take it home. High end frette sheets, pillow menu (including herb scented, if you wanted). Bose music system with ipod dock and free wireless internet. Turndown service was lovely and our floor was absolutely silent overnight even though there were a lot of kids staying at the hotel this weekend.Things one doesn't often think about are easily available here: 24 hour room service with extensive menus (even overnight) and extensive ability to serve dinner in the room or hold a catered cocktail party. (all for a high price, of course) as well as all of the concierge service, personal shopper service, etc.. you would expect of a 5 star hotel.We did not eat here, but the bar and hotel resturant, 16, get good reviews elsewhere.SpaThe healthclub and spa are connected. Tea/coffee/comp juice, water, etc.. all toiletries, towels, etc.. are available in the locker room. Steam room and sauna are located in both men's locker room and women's locker room. The only SLIGHTLY disappointing aspect of this hotel is the small size of the pool. It was not particularly large and max depth is 4'6&quot; w/ no outdoor space. All indoors, nicely appointed comfy furniture, and nice floor to ceiling windows.Overall: Ive never stayed anywhere nicer. I don't think I ever opened any door myself other than the door to my room! The level of service was astounding down to the valet leaving bottled water in our car for our trip home. Cant wait to find an excuse to stay here again. The level of service was amazing and the staff EXCEPTIONALLY professional and pleasant whether you appeared to be wealthy or middle class. Wide variety of guests stayed the weekend I did and and everyone I saw was treated very well.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 3 2009 \\t5 stars! Elegant refined!\\tI live in the Chicago area and decided to book the hotel for a weekend getaway.I found cheaper prices for the hotel through expedia and hotels.com. Trump hotel website prices are higher. But if you call the hotel directly they will match any competitor's rate. Upon arriving service was impeccable. They make a point to know your name at arrival,take your bags, check-in. I requested a quiet room and chocolate covered strawberries for my mother's day getaway. The front desk was more than polite. The front desk person personally escorted me to my room. She showed my the amenties and if I had any other questions to let them know.Shortly thereafter the bellman showed up with my luggage.The room was very big for hotel standards. over 600 sq ft.The bathroom had a deep soaking tub- heaven! Large shower head with a handheld shower as well. TV was in the mirror. Fluffy very comfortable thick spa like robes.2 items lacking:-Lack of towel bars to hang towels- speaker system for music in the bathroom- they have this at other hotels. would have been nice to play music and enjoy a bath.Kitchenette- had all the essentials- dishwasher, sink, stovetop, dishes, silverware.mini fridge, microwaveitems lacking: soap, dishwashing soap and towels and washcloths.- There is an awesome espresso machine. Easy to use, very good espresso.Bedding: most comfortable bed I have slept on ....you certainly get more than enough pillows. I had 8 in all! Bose clock radio and ipod docking station- wonderful40 inch LCD tv with DVD below in cabinet. -excellent. Figuring out the DVD was tricky since you had to go thru the main menu- if you have problems ask the front desk.Wireless- free and fast!Drapes: push of a button and they automatically close.Lightning: all lightning in the suite is on dimmers... wonderful!Overall the service is wonderful. Room was amazing.Hotel lives up to it's expectations. I even had chocolate strawberries at no charge.Parking is expensive- but that is to be expected. You are in downtown Chicago- every hotel and even the public parking garages are pricey. Don't expect cheap parking in the city. You are better off taking cabs, buses or the L. The hotel is more than accomodating to your needs and wants.Hotel restaurant although very snobby and chic- service and attention is wonderful.Breakfast very overpriced, but that comes with the territory. High end hotel, high end prices. If you have problems with prices at a hotel like this, this isn't the place to stay.Excellent hotel and location. Walking distance to mag mile and the stores.5 stars!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Apr 28 2009 \\texpensive stay!\\tTrump is a beautiful hotel inside and out located on the Chicago River. I stayed in a one bedroom full kitchen suite. My room was extraordinary. View was nice. The bathroom has a walk in shower and separate toilet. Main distinction in bath area is the in mirror television. The suite has a full kitchen equip with dishes and pots and pans and a microwave oven. Living room has a sectional and a desk with wifi. Suite comes with a fireplace. I was impressed.Issues I had: none of the televisions works throughout my stay, luckily I was not there to watch television.Parking is 50 dollars a day! The guys that parked my vehicle returned is covered in what looked like paint, but I was able to wash it off. No one acknowledged it!When I went to complain that 50 dollars a day should protect my vehicle from such things everyone looked as though I was crazy and hilucinating and imagined the whole thing. I called to have the televisions fixed to no avail. The televisions continued to shut on and off all night waking from my sleep and creeping me out.Upon check out the service clerks were extremely snuddy and unapologetic for my stay. For someone who has recieved perfect service at places that I have spent less money the tower of Trumps is not worth it! 600+ dollars per night should include a few perks for the guest, and at the very least superb customer service. After I wrote a letter to the hotel about my stay I was compensated for 2 nights of parking.But I gave this hotel an overall of average, because I will not patronize the hotel again! I would rather pay more money to a hotel I know will fully satisfy my needs. Anything more than average mean I would stay there again, and this is not the case for the Trump towers.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Apr 27 2009 \\tToo eccentric...\\tStayed last weekend at the Trump Chicago (#2634) and I must admit I just didnt get it.Sure its a nice say with attentive staff, good amenities, Bose iPod dock, clean and well maintained rooms with great views and comfortable beds. I would expect no less. But why do I need a fully kitted out island kitchen in my suite??? What do you do with a dishwasher with no soap to do any dishes? Same with the sink, no soap to clean up even if I did dirty the full set of dishes, silver, wine glasses and cookware (there is no exhaust over the cook top so even if you really felt the need to do any real cooking you most likely would set off all of the buildings smoke detectors). Was I to just leave a sink full of dirty pots, pans and dishes for housekeeping? It seems just an odd amenity to make it completely peculiar and useless in my view. I dont travel to be a hermit in an SRO-like hotel room, I dont care how opulent it is. Also, it had the strangest shower/tub layout I have come across in a developed country. Why do the tub and the shower need to occupy the same space and why just a single sink and no separate room for the toilet? The suite also had a lighting control system designed by NASA. I couldnt imagine ever having the need for so much light control in a 700 sq. ft. room.Overall, it is a nice new property with a good location and I did enjoy my stay but I must say I must not be cut out to live like The Donald, all a bit theatrical and affected for me including the $1000.

The best hotel we've ever stayed in - EVER!\\tMy new wife and I stayed at the Trump Hotel and Tower in Chicago as a special treat on our 5 week USA Honeymoon.My wife and I have travelled many times to different places in many different countries, and this is by far one of the most amazing hotels we have ever stayed in. The service, amenities, rooms and staff are all absolutely amazing. We were thrilled with every single aspect of our stay and we just wish that we could have spent even more time there.The manager of the hotel left a beautiful platter of chocolate dipped strawberries and champagne as he knew that we were on our honeymoon. All the staff seemed genuinely eager to please, especially the concierge desk who really couldn't do enough for you. On a couple of occasions they recommended restaurants to us, and they were excellent each and every time.We absolutely loved the whole city of Chicago and can't wait to get back there is just so much to see and do. But the main reason we'll be back is to come to the Trump. Mr, Trump you should be impressed! The staff &amp; hotel are a real credit to you - this place is amazing.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 5 2009 \\tExceptional Hotel\\tWe rented a the Grand Deluxe 1 Bedroom King Suite with Lake View for my mother's big occasion birthday. The room was incredible - enormous with two bathrooms, floor to ceiling windows in the living room and bedroom with breathtaking views of the river, the lake, and downtown. My parents spent the night in the suite and the rest of hung out before and after dinner and the kids used the pool. Although it was expensive, we spit the cost among family, and it turned out to be an excellent way to wow and impress someone. I didn't use the spa facilities but heard that they were awesome. BTW - the rate on the hotel web site was very high; I called the hotel directly and the front desk offered to give me a discount.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 4 2009 \\tAmazing...Book through Virtuoso for the best deals.\\tFirst off, the booking. We used Virtuoso and got a fantastic rate. $230/night, $50 Spa Gift Card, $60 for breakfast every morning, and an upgrade (if available) on arrival. When we arrived, the doorman asked about our visit, and remembered every detail and asked about it daily. We were upgraded to a room not much bigger (650--&gt;900 square feet), however it was directly in front of the river...the best view ever. The room was clean, large, and amazing...words cannot describe it. The bathroom was large and filled with every bath soap, gel, and salt you could possibly want. The In-Mirror TV was perfect for staying up with the news while we showered. We were able to get as many papers as we wanted in the morning, and chose the Tribune and the NYT, which was delivered by 6 every morning. Room service was spectacular, but expensive (although not for us). The Spa, although not used by myself, was apparently flawless. The Health Club was the best integration of technology I've ever seen. The staff was always there, and they were friendly and professional. The only problem we ran into was that the Housekeeping Computers accidentally had us checking out a day early, but everything was quickly fixed, and no other problems occurred. The concierge recommended Bistro 110, up near Water Tower Place, and was the best casual dining experience we've ever had. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, for its service, its rooms, and its overall experience.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 9 2009 \\tFantastic\\tI wanted a romantic weekend getaway to Chicago and the Trump delivered. For about half the price of a room at the Four Seasons we had a room that met or even exceeded the Four Seasons experience. I did not end up using the hotels other amenities. We had other plans made for dining and the spa was priced beyond a price I felt was reasonable even for a splurge. But the room and the service from all hotel employee was an unbelievable value. When economic times improve, I wouldn't be surprised to find the price to stay become heavy for most budgets, so now may be the time if you want to treat yourself and someone special to a real upscale treat. I was not asked for any donation as I read in a different post. Only one minor complaint was that one morning my shower did not quite get as hot as I would have liked, but other times it did.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 8 2009 \\tMost Memorable Stay Ever\\tWe have just returned from the most memorable hotel stay ever! The staff at the Trump Hotel exceeding our expectations in every way. My husband and I were going to stay to celebrate our Birthdays and decided at the last minute to take our childlren. I am so glad we did, as they received the most amazing treatment ever. This hotel really caters to children and as parents really appreciated the special treatment. Not only did they keep our children busy but the little details they add to make it enjoyable and relaxing for the parents is out of this world. I was so sad it check out as I didn't want this experience to end. Definitely worth every penny we spent. The service is what makes this hotel so unique. In a world filled with terrible service at every turn, it is a breath of fresh air when you find staff that takes such pride in their work. My kids have already asked if they can forego their next Florida vacation and stay at the Trump. I LOVED IT!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 27 2009 \\tBeautiful room view and location!!\\tWe have stayed here twice recently with our sons age 4 and 2, November 2008 and February 2009. The suites are amazing, huge and beautiful, the windows are floor to ceiling and the view is fantasitc, the only way to travel with young children. Kitchen with microwave, stove, expresso machine, silverware/plates, and a fridge you can put your own things in to. Master bath with TV in mirror, comfy robes. Staff is so friendly, remember our names, ask how things are, answer any ?'s we may have. Upon arrival to our room there were 2 plates with the boys names in chocolate and 2 huge cookies each, which of course they loved! We ordered room service twice in both our stays and the food is fantastic and there was a kitchen table we could all sit at. Pool is very nice, there are even toys for the boys to play with! The air is very warm but my one complaint here is I think the pool is cold, of course once you are in it's fine, but my boys couldn't stay in longer then 25 minutes and they were shivering and lips were blue, very minor, but thought I would include for those travelling with young children. Now for my complaints, the first time we stayed we had a prob with the tv in the bedroom, we couldn't control the volume, couple of phone calls later we had a new tv, not a big deal. However, 2nd stay, the dvd player in the bedroom didn't work, the one in the living room worked fine, called 3 times, first 2 times someone came while we were out, and the player was still not working. I think they were &quot;fixing&quot; the living room one which was fine. the 3rd time I called and let them know what was happening and that we would be in the room to show the broken one. No one showed up. based on this I gave a 4 instead of a 5.\\t\\n\",\n",

We were allowed to bring our pup who weighs under 10 lbs. They even brought in a bed for our pup, a dish for her, a collar and leash, treats, poop bags for when we walk her, etc. The concierge provided us with written confirmation of our dinner arrangements outside the hotel upon our arrival. The room was immaculate and the service was spectacular. It was worth every dime. We will definitely stay there again.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Feb 9 2009 \\tExceeded all expectations\\tWe had an awesome time at Trump Chicago this past weekend. Our suite exceeded all of our expectations (and, we have high expectations - we typically stay at the Ritz, Four Seasons or Peninsula in Chicago). We stayed in a deluxe one-bedroom suite. It was at least 1,500 square feet. The kitchen and both bathrooms were beautifully decorated, stocked and appointed. The fireplace in the living room area was a very nice touch. The bedroom part of the suite was huge and included an enormous dressing area just outside of the master bathroom. This hotel clearly anticipates guests needs and delivers - in most high end hotels, you have to request what you need for a bath (salts, oils, sponge, etc.) - Trump includes all of this with the room. In the kitchen, we had a very nice selection of high end teas and an espresso machine. The Sub-Zero refrigerator was stocked with all sorts of alcoholic and soft drinks. In fact, the suite was so nice that we canceled our dinner reservations at a nearby restaurant, visited a local grocery store and made dinner in the suite! The staff at Trump delivered a bottle of chilled champagne and a tray of chocolate-covered strawberries to our suite as we were arriving - we enjoyed these treats as we prepared dinner. I should mention that our suite had very high ceilings - the drapes were so long that they opened/closed electronically, by pressing buttons on the wall. The huge expanse of ceiling to floor windows overlooked the Chicago river and nearby buildings - very urban - we felt like we were downtown Chicago residents. All of the lights in the suite were on dimmers so that we could create some very romantic conditions throughout the suite in the evening. I could go on and on - but, I'll wrap up by saying that Sunday brunch at Sixteen was awesome - especially the dessert selections. And, the pool area/fitness center was in line with a 5-star resort - very impressive. Finally, I loved the staff - everyone who we encountered went over the top to make sure that we had everything that we needed and wanted right when we requested it - from simple things like a DVD to watch on Saturday night to stocking my favorite green tea in the suite - no request went unanswered - and every request was handled professionally and timely. I couldn't have been more impressed.\\t\\n\",\n",

Then they asked for a donation. We decided to do the donation at the end of the trip. Apparently if you do not give a donation you will be treated differently. From then on the front staff was extremely snobby. We stayed four nights and they called us by the wrong name daily. We were waiting on a cab and another &quot;more important&quot; guest walked out and they tried to give our cab to them. The nice lady reminded the guy that we were waiting first. Rebar has a great view but good luck getting a table. They had a private function 2 nights that were were there and the other night all of the tables were reserved but no one was there. The drinks are over priced and the service is less than desirable. There is no other bar to go to in the hotel. Our ice machine broke twice while we were there and they did not fix it for 2 days. FYI there is not an ice machine on the floor. you have to call room service and they bring it 2 hours later. No wonder they have a hard time filling their hotel rooms. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Stop in and take a look but there are so many other lovely, non-snobbish hotels. For the amount of money that you spend to stay in this overpriced hotel service should be awesome. We did not leave a donation at this money hungry establishment.\\t\\n',\n",

We ate at Sixteen which was very expensive but great food, incredible service and perfect views. The Rebar was very fun. We used the spa for several services and had very mixed feelings. Everything was first class here but every time we were in the spa there were screaming children running around. We have used many spas and have never encountered this before. All guests at the hotel can use the spa locker room, pool and health club area so guests with children were using it at the same time we were trying to have a relaxing spa experience. we have 4 children and love kids but we were trying to get away for a couple of days!\\t\\n',\n",

       " \"Jan 12 2009 \\tFantastic and enjoyable--Chef Bernacci is amazing!\\tI live in Chicago, but had the chance to stay at Trump a few months ago and couldn't pass it up. I've traveled quite a bit and stayed in everything from lowly hostels (Amsterdam, Munich, etc.) to a plantation-style resort (Costa Rica). Plus, I used to work in the hotel industry and got to see lots of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; detail.This experience gives me, IMHO, a pretty balanced take on what to expect from a luxury stay. With that perspective, I can confidently say that Trump deserves top marks and recognition as a luxury location.I don't fault other reviewers for their notes on attention to detail and expectations of service. Certainly, they have a right to expect nothing but the best. What puzzles me is the quality and number of accolades each review gives, only to leave behind a low star rating!My experience: greeted warmly and asked if we needed help to our room. As noted, we're from Chicago and didn't have much stuff, so we went alone. The room was stunning. Our view faced the Northwest, which is prettiest at night. Of course I would have enjoyed a better view of downtown, but that was my doing--can't fault the hotel there!My wife and I got a couples massage--my first massage ever--in the exquisite spa. Seriously, it's the kind of place you only see in movies. The attention and service there was perfect. For a guy who didn't think he could lay still for an hour massage, I was surprisingly happy as a clam. What a wonderful experience.We went back to the room and ordered dinner. When they brought it in, our table was transformed and I felt like I was in a 5-star restaurant. Very nice. The food is mind-blowing. I had the chance to try an appetizer at the bar at Trump a few months earlier and still rave about it. The full meal was even better. Perhaps most impressive is that they were able to get everything up to the room hot and tasty. The was the first time I've had room service where the quality hadn't been compromised.We'd planned on going out in the evening, but opted to stay in. I think it's a good sign for Trump when I'd rather lay around and watch pay-per-view (IronMan) in bed instead of heading a block over to Andy's Jazz!Our breakfast the next morning was wonderful, and our check-out experience flawless. I found every person to be helpful and pleasant and the quality of the rooms and amenities world-class.If you are just looking for a place to crash and have a few hundred dollars to spend, you're going to get a great bed and fantastic food. If you're looking for a nice getaway, whether from Chicago or not, Trump is a memorable indulgence. Rather than trying to convince yourself if wasn't worth it, relish the experience: visit the spa, eat the food, get a drink in the bar--let yourself feel like royalty for a bit! You won't regret it.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 12 2009 \\tThis Place Trumps Them All\\tI recently stayed at the Trump following the Christmas Holidays. It was an opportunity to relax and spend some time with my nephew. The stay was such an amazing experience, from start to finish. My nephew loved the milk and cookies and the fact that there was an X-box waiting for him made the whole weekend. The rooms are beautifully appointed and immaculately kept. The pool/spa has to be one of the most relaxing I've ever visited. Brunch at 16 was exquisite, the view breathtaking! I highly recommend the whole experience. I can't wait to return for another weekend getaway.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jan 7 2009 \\tLetting things slip...\\tI have been a lurker on this site for a couple years and after my recent stay at Trump I decided that I needed to write a review about my experience.I have stayed at Trump three times now. The first two times were phenomenal! My family and I have always stayed in the 46 type room between the 19-23 floors. We love the view of the Wrigley Building and the magnificent Chicago lake front and river. The rooms were always flawless, the service was great and there was not much more that we could ask for. Upon arrival our favorite doorman, MK, greeted us by name, said he was so glad that we were back and helped us to check in as usual. It was a great start to what should have been a fabulous stay. Then things started going downhill, first of all, we had to wait a good 5 minutes before anyone came to the front desk. Where was all the staff? One of the male concierges came over and started chatting with us; he was charismatic and let us know that if there was anything he could do for us, to please let him know. Well, there is something he could have done, he could have either checked us in or got someone to check us in. Instead of doing either of those things he went back to his desk and started chatting with one of his coworkers. When someone finally did check us in they were very nice. She acknowledged that we were return guests and said she was glad that we had come back to stay at Trump. Then she gave us our keys. I need to stop here for a second. The last two times I have stayed at this hotel not only was I not handed my keys, I had someone take my family up to the room, show us where things were and of course open the door for us. As I took the key, I didnt think too much of it, but after everything that happened during our stay I can now see how our stay was destined for disaster from the get go. When we got to our room, everything was beautiful as usual, our youngest daughter called down to attach to see if she could get an XBOX, and they obliged, two hours later it wasnt in our room and when we called down to inquire we found out that they had left for the night. In previous stays we had always called the attach desk as late as 11:00pm with someone there to grant our wishes and now at 9:00pm no one was there? It wasnt even a holiday. Before heading out for some shopping my husband and I decided we wanted to stop by the concierge desk to see our favorite concierge Alexzandra. To our dismay we found out that she was recently transferred to another property. When we did ask the concierge questions the girl either didnt know the answer or was robotic. I dont ask that much of a concierge, but when I want to go to a fine dining option that isnt as mainstream as Charlie Trotters I expect the concierge to deliver, and she did not. As a family we heavily rely on a concierge. We like to be able to throw out an idea and have the concierge make it happen, and on this trip things just werent the same. We decided to go to restaurants we had already been to since the two concierges we spoke to could not come up with anything that we hadnt already been to. My oldest daughter is a fashion forward 16 year old who loves exploring Chicagos indie neighborhoods. Normally the concierge would come up with a detailed plan of attack for her stay, but no one seemed interested in providing a level of service that actually required some thought. Needless to say we were disappointed and she was bored.I think the most disappointing service issue we had was that there was an overall lack of attention given to my family. The only person who called my family by name was MK, all of the other staff members didnt even make an effort to address us by name. No one was particularly rude, but at the five star level I want extraordinary and that is what I used to get at the Trump, and it is a shame that that is no longer the case.During our first two trips to the Trump, service seemed to be of the utmost importance to this hotel, they had staff everywhere. They had great staff. Now, it seems like they are cutting back on their most valuable asset and forgetting why their customers stay there. I dont stay at a hotel to be left alone; I stay at a hotel to be pampered! I want somebody to open the door for me, I want the concierge to know my name and I want to be escorted to my room. When I am paying thousands of dollars a night, I expect the best, and Trump did not deliver.Mr. Trump, you have a lot invested in this property, I advise you to go and stay there. I think you should see what your hard earned money has bought you. This hotel is slipping, I have quite honestly received better service at Holiday Inns then I did on my last stay at your hotel. We used to LOVE your hotel, my daughters begged me to bring them back here, but after the service (lack of) we received on our most recent visit we will be going back to the Peninsula, as they have continually met our needs without a bat of the eye.I dont want a refund for my stay, I want my time back and that is far more valuable than any monetary sum this hotel could refund me.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Dec 29 2008 \\tA disappointing experience\\tOurs was a disappointing experience. Sure the rooms are large and the gym is great but that's about it.We checked in on Sunday evening( 3 rooms). No one showed us to our rooms--&quot;&quot;heres the keys and use them to go up in the elevator&quot;. Thats all. No one accompanied us as other writers have noted. The next morning problems began. There was inadequate water pressure and the water temperature was tepid. My sons, in their rooms, experienced the same. I, of course complained and was assured that it would be rectified. When we returned later, the bathroom was left a mess by the engineer. I was told it was fixed.  The next day I discovered that the water pressure and the temperature was not fixed and I had to use the gym to have a hot shower. Now I was really upset. The hotel then sent 2 engineers who spent 2 hours sharing our room trying to fix it. Their 1st effort failed but eventually they got it right. The doormen were hit and miss--some times they opened the doors and other times. they didn't. The concierge desk usually, but not always, was manned. Although we were there for 3 nights, I only saw a &quot;clefs d'or&quot; once and then only for a brief period. The bar has a drink menu and prices. Yet, they charged more. When questioned, we were told the menu was wrong. When told they can't so that, the waitress threw down the bill.  They also closed the bar early. Not once did I ever see a manager. Not once did anyone with any level of authority ask about our stay. I was told that the managers are on the 2d floor and therefore didn't interact with the guests. Compare this with a 4 Seasons etc where a management rep is always present. Now here is the height of chutzpah. The trump does not have a guest comment card in the room. Instead they sent me an e-mail form which was user unfriendly--I had to answer all questions although not relevant. Last but not least, the form asked how much money I make. What does this have to do with how Trump is operating his hotel In conclusion, this is a poorly managed hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 29 2008 \\tOne of the Best Ever\\tAfter being bumped from the W Lakeshore because they were oversold, hotels.com helped secure me a room at the Trump. It was like dying and going to heaven. As dank and dismal as the W is, the Trump is nothing short of one of the finest properties I've ever stayed at. In addition to large, spacious, luxurious, sumptuous rooms and bathrooms, the real story here is impeccable service from the most professional staff I've experienced and interacted with. From top to bottom - the doormen, the reception staff, the concierges, there is AAA quality that is so rare these days. This must be the nicest property in Chicago these days, if not the nicest in the country. Absolutely 10 out of 10 experience for the discerning traveler and I highly, highly recommend. It is one of the few places that is expensive and worth it. My only regret is staying for only two nights. I would've loved to stay for a month.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 22 2008\\tNot impressed\\tThe Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower Chicago is a nice enough hotel. It is relatiely new, so (most of) the decor is fresh and unspoiled.I booked directly with the hotel. I explained that I had the online floorplan in front of me as I was talking, and was only interested in the larger of the two-bedroom suites. (The '00' floorplan.) I didn't look at any other floorplans, since I wanted the best available room and, based on the floorplan, that was obviously it. I was quoted the rate, and reserved my room.Case closed, right?The room rate, plus taxes, for a two-bedroom suite ends up being just under $2,000/night.It's not like I'd committed the floorplan to memory, much less those of other rooms/suites. When I arrived at my room, something just wasn't right. I didn't know what it was, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting.Still, my stay was relatively uneventful. I had a few problems with housekeeping, and staff getting the name wrong in correspondence. But nothing that would specifically preclude me from staying at the Trump hotel (Chicago) again. It was only after arriving home that I realized why the room seemed less than impressive.About a week after my stay, I went online to show someone why I'd booked that particular room. (Clearly, in the floorplan, you can see the '00' rooms are the biggest, and thus, probably the best, in my books.) Only then did I realize the hotel staff had given me the smaller two-bedroom suite. I couldn't believe it. Not only had I specifically booked the '00' floorplan, clearly stating that I did not want the smaller two-bedroom suite, but all my &quot;eAttache&quot; correspondence referred to the larger two-bedroom floorplan, as well.If this was an innocent mistake, then it falls right in line with the myriad other little mistakes staff made during my stay. (Nothing major. Just puzzling.) However, I suspect they just didn't want to put me in the larger suite...for whatever &quot;reason.&quot;So, while I would have likely stayed there again had I either been put in the correct room, or never learned of the switcheroo, I must admit that since learning of this, I have zero plans to stay at Trump again.The thing is, I'm going to Chicago again in a couple of weeks. I'll likely stay at Park Hyatt or some other hotel where the two-bedroom suite I book, is the two-bedroom suite I get. Imagine that!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 12 2008 \\tGreat first impression of the Trump\\tOn my last trip to Chicago, I decided to stay at the Trump after finding out that everything was booked that weekend. Our de facto hotel is the W Chicago City Center for convenience, but my preference when staying for more than one night is to be closer to the River area.The W was charging $569/night for the basic room, and the Trump was $575. The W charged for internet access, but the Trump comped it, so the Trump was actually cheaper. As I got closer to the trip, I found that the Sofitel Water Tower was actually $413/night, so I actually booked there and canceled the Trump. When I called to cancel at the Trump, I was delighted and surprised that they decided to match my rate at the Sofitel. So I went back and canceled my Sofitel reservation.The Trump is a full-service hotel. When you step out of your car/cab, there is a guy to open the door. There's another guy to take your luggage. When you're checking in, the luggage guy is there waiting for you to get settled, and then leads you to the room. You are then given a tour of the room. Service is impeccable.The facilities are first-class. You have a TV built into the mirror of the bathroom as well as a larger flat-screen in the main hotel room area. The main room is probably 500 to 600 square feet--almost twice the size of my small Manhattan studio. The windows are essentially floor-to-ceiling. Every unit in the main tower has a kitchenette wth a small Subzero refrigerator/freezer, so no trips to the ice machine. There's a cabinet full of dishes, plates, silverware, even pots/pans and cooking utensils. The shower is huge, and there is a sunken tub in the shower area.I could go on, but the point is that the accommodations are first-class. The service is perfect. Even the room service is brainless--they bring in the food and leave you with a bill that includes gratuity that you don't even need to sign.The one niggle I had was a small one. In my haste to check out, I didn't realize until I was literally on the plane that I left both of my Blackberries in the hotel room. The hotel of course found them, but it took a little bit of calling back and forth to confirm this. They overnighted the units back to me in NY, but they did charge my credit card for the delivery (not a big deal, since this was my fault).I'd stay here again in a heartbeat, but for $575/night, I might be tempted to try the Peninsula--or the Sofitel for more than $100 less.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 12 2008 \\tA great personalized experience\\tWe stayed here for our annual &quot;Christmas in the City&quot; with our kids (staying downtown to enjoy Chicago this time of year and making it a &quot;special treat&quot;).We had one of the one-bedroom suites. At about 1100 square feet, there was plenty of space for the 4 of us to stretch out. The decor is wonderful (modern, but not over the top). Good color pallate, too - very relaxing. The &quot;fireplace&quot; in the room was purely for show, though (no heat - just the appearance of a fireplace with red lights to simulate the fire).The king bed was very comfortable and the &quot;pillow menu&quot; allows you to specify the number and type of pillows you'd like to have for the room (my wife and daughters each had their own body pillow in addition to the standard pillow and I had one of the contour pillows that supports your head better than a standard pillow). My only issue is that the sofabed is somewhere between a full and queen in size - not quite big enough for my two daughters (9 and 7), so we ended up sharing the king bed, too.Nice in-room amenities including fridge, microwave, cooktop, sink, and dishware to cook/reheat your food (if you bring in or have them cook in the room for you - too pricey for us). The Nepresso (sp?) espresso maker was also much appreciated.The girls also enjoyed the pool (at the healthclub/spa) particularly since, at this time of year, there was no one else in it - they felt like princesses with their own pool!We'd certainly come back and recommend to our visiting friends/relatives.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dec 12 2008 \\tDonald Trump has style - and knows how to do a hotel right!\\tMy wife and I decided to head to downtown Chicago for a romantic weekend and spa excursion. We reviewed several hotels, some we had frequented in the past, others were new - but we decided to visit the Trump Chicago, and it was well worth every penny spent.The Trump provides a true five-star experience. The check-in process is easy, and the folks behind the desk are very courteous. They actually show you to your room and demonstrate how to use all of the features in the room. Our room was on the spa floor and had great views of the city and Chicago river. The room was larger than other hotel rooms in the downtown area and exuded a sense of calm. All materials used in construction were top-notch, and the earth tone paint was a calming counter to the bustling cityscape below. Everything on the Magnificent Mile and State Street (Streeterville) was a short walk from the Trump. The bar at Trump (ReBar) was very cosmopolitan, and featured a selection of high-end sake.The spa was an example of absolutely superb service in and of itself. The host at the spa was absolutely amazing - he was truly involved, and Trump could not have found a better person for the job. The ambiance was incredibly calming, from the superb teas to a knockout massage - it was all there. Most importantly, the spa felt exclusive. There were no crowds of people waiting for services in robes, etc.However, not everything was &quot;perfect&quot; in paradise. If you buy a package which provides extra spa services or incentives, bring your confirmation and know what you are getting. The spa computer systems are not linked to your package, so you need to ask for the package credit upon departure. Parking was not part of the hotel stay - plan on around $20.00/day for public parking at the hotel, more for valet service. One last concern is that the adult TV movies and titles are visible by default - we were not concerned, but a family with kids may very well be.Ultimately, if you are in search of an awesome hotel experience and even better spa excursion, the Trump will deliver better than almost all others.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Nov 27 2008 \\ttime at the Trump\\tOverall, we enjoyed our stay at the Trump. We made good use of the kitchen in our suite to make meals. We appreciated the spacious dimensions of the room, the quality appointments in the bathrooms, toiletries, and bed in the room. However, the sofa bed was not very comfortable, too soft and saggy in the middle. Really appreciated FREE wi-fi. Why can't everyone offer this? Every employee we encountered was friendly, helpful, and well-trained in offering service. The only downside on service was that there was only one person at the check-in desk, and there was a long line of people waiting behind us. Attache services were prompt, from requesting plastic wrap, to a glass of milk. We made use of the spa, and the treatments (massages) were wonderful; the technicians were great. The locker facilities could use a little maintenance on the shower doors, some of which wouldn't lock, and more hair dryers would be appreciated. Room service was very prompt and the serving sizes generous. Overall, a good experience, but to reach the level of a top notch luxury hotel, which it is aspiring to be, will take some work. Special kudos to Olin at the Spa, who took the time to explain everything related to the spa and treatments to us in a patient, friendly way.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 26 2008 \\tWell worth the price!\\tWe stayed here during what appeared to be the quietest of all the weeks of the year. This place was a ghost town! We loved it. We had so much personal attention. The Bellmen knew our name...the concierge knew us...the housekeeper even used our name! The room (a suite) was absolutely lovely! Our son slept on the pull out sleeper couch and our 10 year old daughter slept on a chaise lounge in our bedroom. She and he were very comfortable. I tell you this because I almost didn't book with this hotel because I was upset about having to pay $50 more dollars for a cot...my daughter was fine with out one and the hotel was gracious about providing us with sheets etc. to make up a bed for her. We paid $470 a night for this two room suite with a city view. We ate breakfast at 16 and it was wonderfully elegant. What a gorgeous setting for a restaurant...especially on a sunshiney bright morning! The pool was huge and clean! The workout facilities were so outstanding! I would stay here again in a minute! Wow, are my kids spoiled!!!!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 20 2008\\tDespite Trump I loved it\\tThe last name on earth I associate with is Donald Trump, but I decided to give this a shot. From the second you enter the door, this is a true 5 star experience, the likes of which I don't think I've ever had anywhere. And I commonly stay at places like St. Regis, etc. etc.You enter the door, you're welcomed, asked your name and escorted to a very discreet desk in the minimalist lobby. In seconds, you have your room, and at least 5 people welcome you by name. The room was a one-bedroom suite, and it was breathtaking. Not only a large living room, but attached to it is a full kitchen, in exquisite style. You can actually cook in this room, although there isn't an oven. Everything is decorated in perfect taste, very expensively, but not ostentagious at all. The bathrooms were beautiful, there's even a flat screen tv built (somehow) in to the mirror!The only negative was the fireplace, which I was looking forward to enjoying. It's completely fake, electric optical-illusion flames, no heat at all. The bar is also magnificent in the hotel, complete with very finely made drinks and a luscious bar menu, with awesome sushi. I am sure that everyone of the highest taste will be pleased with this hotel. it's a truly premium class experience.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 13 2008 \\tBest Hotel in Chicago\\tWe normally stay at the Peninsula or the Park Hyatt but both were booked. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and decided to check out Trump's new hotel. Everything was wonderful. We had a 2 bedroom executive suite with outstanding views of the lake and the Navy pier. Our rooms were beautiful and the amenities were top notch. We also used the spa, pool and exercise facilities. Everything was great. Loved the deluge shower and steam room. Our 9 year old was with us and he had a ball. It was his first trip to Chicago and he was treated like a prince by everyone at the hotel. They even supplied us with an Xbox 360 set up for the room. I thought it was a great value considering we normally spend the same amount for a one bedroom suite at the Peninsula and our 2 bedroom suite was twice the size. Not only that we had a full size living, dining and Kitchen. It's a great value for a family since it sleeps 6 with the sofa bed. Most importantly the service was better than any I have ever had at other luxury hotels anywhere. The check-in was flawless, We even got a welcome from the general manager. We ate at 16 and had the chef's tasting menu. The service was excellent and the food to die for. Our couple's spa treatment was perfect.We travel to Chicago often and this will be our new hotel from now on.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 2 2008 \\tAmazing hotel\\tThis is an absolutely amazing hotel. We managed to afford it becuase we got a special deal as it was still being constructed. As we were leaving there were only small amounts of building work left to complete. We didn't have any noise from the construction work. The room was massive. Everything you could possibly need was there. Only minor thing was that even though lots of coffee was provided only 2 Coffee Mate creamers were left - so had to buy our own. Hotel is in a fantastic location - at the end of the Magnificent Mile and next to the Wrigley building. If we win the lottery we would definitely return!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Oct 17 2008 \\tNot just over the top but over whatever is over the top.\\tI am not enamored of the Trump image but booked this hotel because it was convenient to a business meeting and had such fine reviews on this site, which I trust. It turned out to be the most impressive hotel stay I can recall. The room was enormous, I liked its design very much. It came with a complimentary tray of chocolate and a complimentary bottle of wine. There was a complete kitchenetter (espresso machine, microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher and sink, tableware, etc.) There was a flat panel tv that, in a wonderful idea that all hotels should embrace, is quiet when you turn it on and the menu screen comes on. Then there was a small flat panel in the bathroom mirror as well. The tub and shower were inside a single glass enclosure, which I liked although others could disagree. There were big drapes that have a motorized control. Plenty of space and seating areas. The room service menu was expansive with an abundance of choices. The spa and health club were also enormous and offered a very wide array of experiences. The staff is lovely. I could not imagine having a nicer stay in a hotel.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 10 2008 \\tWriting This Review While Still on Property\\tI plan on following up with a full review later, however, I wanted to give an initial impression while we're still on property.

With that said, we ( myself, wife, and 7 year old daughter ) have found ourselves forced to slow down and forget our busy schedules, etc. We could not be happier.....\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Oct 5 2008\\tExtraordinary\\tWhat a difference a few months make. After a relatively disappointing stay at the Trump in the spring---the property was shockingly unfinished---I just returned from an extraordinary visit. This trip I booked a one bedroom, river view suite, took advantage of the excellent '16' restaurant and the fabulous spa. All told the hotel is incredibly well appointed, the rooms are beautiful, has a wonderful friendly and accomodating staff, and has what many five star properties in Chicago lack---genuine sophistication. I usually stay at the Penninsula or The Four Seasons..but for this visit the Trump surpassed them both.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 1 2008 \\tWow! Wow! Wow!\\tThis by far is one of the best hotels out there. The spa rooms are beautiful. We had floor to ceiling windows that overlooked the river. The bathrooms are luxurious and include fancy shampoos and my favorite, the sugar body scrub. We had a TV in the mirror and a flat screen in the main room. The closet had a towel/compress heater which was nice to use in bed after our showers. The service was like no other. He must send these professionals to &quot;Nice&quot; school because there wasn't one person that wasn't friendly and helpful, which is hard to find. I had a drink in the Rebar, also the waitress was kind. The view with the dim lighting was relaxing. We also visited the pool, gym, and spa on our last day. All are located on the 15 floor. While waiting for my massage a gentleman asked if I would like tea made from fresh loose leaf. I declined but it smelled nice. The gym has state of the art equipment. My husband said it was the nicest he had seen. We were traveling with our 4 1/2 year old and he too felt welcome here. They loved children. Housekeeping sent up his own robe and slippers that said &quot;Trump Kids&quot;, how cute. The last day Trump and his family arrived for the opening of the residence side of the building. I wish I would have had the chance to tell him what a great job he did with this hotel. We will stay here every time we visit Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 24 2008 \\tSimply the best\\tI don't like Donald Trump but I loved his hotel. This is a fairly new addition to Chicago and what a step up! It's right along the Chicago River with lovely river and lake views. You can see Navy Pier as well and I can imagine get a great view of the fireworks. We had an Executive King Suite. These rooms are located on the upper floors of the hotel and have secured elevator access. Our room was huge approx 700 square feet. There was a large open living, dining and kitchen area...with a fully equipped kitchen. There is a large bedroom and a luxurious bathroom with integrated television inside the mirror. My son said it was, &quot;magic&quot;. I have to agree. The furnishings and ambiance are modern and luxurious. It's a great place to stay with children. They greeted my kids with cotton candy. They also provided a crib with lovely linens (although the crib itself was somewhat smaller than full size). The staff were so friendly and lovely with the kids from the front desk to the doorman. I look forward to returning to this lovely hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 23 2008 \\tAbove and beyond\\tMy boyfriend booked us a room at The Trump as a surprise for our anniversary. Of course, with the name Trump attached to this hotel, you expect a lavish, upscale hotel. Aside from being lavish and upscale, this hotel has customer service that far surpassed any expectations I had. Upon arrival to the hotel, every staff member knew my boyfriend and I by name, greeted us with genuine smiles and were always very quick to offer help and assistance in anyway we needed.Our room was not ready when we arrived so to make up for our delay, the hotel upgraded our suite to a 1500 square foot room and offered complimentary drinks at their on-site bar, Rebar. After having a few non-alcoholic drinks (I am expecting), we went back to the front desk to check on the status of our room, which was still not ready. Shortly after explaining that I was expecting and needed to get situated so that we could go to dinner, our room was ready. The room was absolutely gorgeous--we had a panoramic view from ceiling to floor of Navy Pier (which later benefitted us as we watched the weekend fireworks show from our chase lounge at 10pm). The spacious room was more like a condo, complete with a full kitchen (microwave, dishwasher, oven, fridge, plates, silverware, etc.) , 2 full bathrooms, living room, dining room, and bedroom. The living room and bedroom both have large flat screen TVs. Each area in the room can be individually temperature controlled. Shortly after settling into our room we received a knock at the door (actually a ring from the doorbell) from room service delivering a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a card wishing us a Happy Anniversary from the staff, complimentary of course.After enjoying that we then received a phone call from the hotel manager apologizing to us for the lengthy wait for our hotel room and offering us a later check-out time and complimentary breakfast of our choice from the restaurant Sixteen or room service (which later totalled to be over $100). Every service that this hotel offers has special extras which makes it even more fun to order. Throughout the night we enjoyed their 24 hour room service, including ordering a Trump Sundae twice. Everytime you order, the staff will gladly set your table for you where ever you choose to dine (near the window, at the dining room table, bedside, etc.).The next morning, our paper was delivered, breakfast was served promptly. We loved the robes and watching TV in the bathroom while getting ready. Upon checkout, we were again greeted by name and asked if everything had met our standards, which it of course did. I would highly reccomend this hotel and would gladly stay again...and again. One more thing, although the hotel is under construction, we were never disturbed by any noise, detours or construction workers. This hotel works hard to ensure that your stay is as peaceful and relaxing as possible.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Sep 22 2008 \\tLoved The Trump\\tI booked a girls weekend at this hotel. Almost didn't book the hotel as read some negative reviews about the service. Not sure where those reviews were coming from because that was not my experience. From the moment that the taxi dropped us off, the service was nearly flawless. The bellman, without seeing luggage knew my name and everyone in the hotel did for that matter. This is the first time at the hotel and it was very impressive. Everyone was so friendly and everyone always said hello no matter where you where on the property. The concierge George was the best. He even walked us to the restaurant for lunch as he thought we might get lost. When we checked in, we received hot towels for our hands and water. Our room-2 bedroom suite was lovely with gorgeous views of the river. This suite had plenty of room for 6 girls. I did tell the reservationist when booking that we were celebrating a birthday. The hotel one day sent us champagne, not a cheap bottle and a tray of chocolate, the next day we received gorgeous flowers and another day we received a chocolate cake. We are not celebrities nor we we paying a rack rate. In fact, I had a rate of pay for two nights and get one night free. I have stayed all over the world and have never been treated so well. The health club was large and brand new. There was a nice touch of putting voss water by your bed each night. The housekeeping service was great and have us as much as voss water as we needed for our stay. Originally I was going to stay at the Sofitel and am so glad that I deccided to stay here. We went to the R-Bar which was nice but didn't stay as the views from our room were better. I wouldn't have any second thoughts about booking here or staying here again. TRUMP really knows how to hire the right people. This was an excellent experience.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 11 2008 \\tAbsolutely loved it\\tWithout a doubt this is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. I was absolutely gutted to be leaving, although that would have something to do with Chicago being such a great place too.The staff were great. Helpful and friendly and couldn't do enough for you.The room was magnificent. Exactly as the website shows. Fantastically clean and with every amenity you could want.The spa was great. It never seemed too crowded and had a decent sized pool.The bar, (rebar), was excellent and the barman was superb. We had a slight problem with some bar snacks and we were comped our drinks for the rest of the evening as an apology - a little touch that makes all the difference.The restaurant, sixteen, is lovely. Massive panoramic windows, look out over Chicago while you dine on great food and wine. Yes it's expensive but hey it's a Trump restaurant, what do you expect?!When we stayed the tower was still being finished, hence the buy one night, get one night free deal that we got, but the construction was on the top floors, (80 floors away), and we never heard a peep of noise or had our stay disrupted in any way.I was expecting the place to be too garish and a little overwhelming in an extravagant Donald Trump style but it was nothing of the sort. Understated elegance is how I would describe it. Quite simply we had an amazing time and I can't wait to go back.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 9 2008 \\tWonderful weekend in Chicago\\tWe just got back from a wonderful weekend at The Trump hotel in Chicago. It was our first visit to the city and we enjoyed every minute of it. The hotel itself was beautiful. Still under some construction but we were not affected by it. The staff was always courteous. The pool and spa were fabulous. We had drinks at Rebar, which was very nice and breakfast one morning at Sixteen. The food was delicious but a little on the expensive side. All in all it was a great trip.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Sep 7 2008 \\tA first class experience\\tWe are a family of four,and stayed for 14 nights at the Trump Tower in August of this year.We stayed in a one-bedroom king apartment overlooking the City.The accommodation was first-class,new,and spotlessly clean.It was also huge-1000 sq feet,two plasma TVs,a fully-stocked kitchen,and two bathrooms,all luxuriously-appointed.Oh-there is also a TV in the mirror in the bathroom if you wish to catch up with the news whilst soaking in the bath!Maid service each day was efficient and unobtrusive,as was turn-down in the evenings.The gym facilities are first-class and were under-used by the other guests during our stay.The pool must be the best that I have ever seen in a luxury hotel-25 yards,with a dedicated lane at one side,and not too warm.It was never crowded,and I must have had the pool to myself on at least half a dozen occasions for lap swimming.The hotel staff are attentive,if at times a little over-enthusiastic!-I don't remember opening a door for myself the whole time that I was there! One word of advice-ask the staff to explain how the lighting system works in the rooms-it is not easy to fathom it out,believe me! We had the air-con go down one day,called the hotel services,and within 15 minutes the engineer was there fixing it-great service.We did not eat in the hotel restaurant,preferring instead to explore those nearby the hotel-none disappointed.It is so central for all of Chicago's attractions,the theatres,museums,and beaches,aswell as shopping,of course! A Hertz car-hire is also literally across the road from the entrance.I would highly recommend this hotel.We had very mildly-intrusive building work noise a couple of mornings,but nothing that one would complain about atall,and if my credit-card could stand it once again,I would definately choose this hotel for my next trip to Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 1 2008 \\tAbsolutely Marvelous\\tMy family and I stayed at this wonderful hotel for a sight seeing trip of Chicago and celebrate my daughters 5th birthday. Everything was perfect. They greeted us with smiles and wished my daughter Happy Birthday, they even had a special cake and card brought to our room. Service throughout our stay was exceptional. The staff catered to our every needs. It was a marvelous experience and we would highly recommend this fine establishment.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 27 2008 \\tGreat but some problems\\tThe Trump Hotel is a beautiful hotel. However, be forewarned that it is still under construction and not expected to be completed until March 2009. We stayed on the 17th floor and did not encounter any noise or problems with the construction. The front desk clerk advised us that the roof had been installed the week before and the balance of the work entailed finishing the interior of the top floors. The room itself is spacious and very well appointed. The linens are excellent as is the built-in television in the bathroom mirror. Some silly touches such as a water menu and grossly overpriced room service. We encounterd a number of problems which merit mentioning. One, we had massages at the hotel spa which were nice, although very expensive. My wife's massage cost $300.00 for an hour and a half. We discovered upon checking out that the hotel automatically charges a 20% gratuity for spa services. We were never told of this charge in advance. We also were charged an additional $300.00 for our room on checking out. When I enquired about the basis for the charge, as I had already prepaid the room in full, I was told it was a mistake. No explanation was offered how this mistake was made. Not very professional for a 5 star hotel. Second, on the first day of our stay we had the unpleasant experience of hotel staff walking unannounced into our room. First it was the maid then it was a porter bringing us a bottle of wine. When we returned from dinner we discovered a cake in our room. Once again, our room had been accessed by staff without our knowledge or consent. It caused us a little concern for our valuables, although they were safely stored in the room safe. Third, my wife and me went to the lobby bar and sat at a table for four beside the window overlooking the river. Bar was busy but not full. Nice but a little pretentious. The waitress first asked us if we were dining and when we indicated we only wanted drinks she stated that the table was reserved for a party of four. No reservation sign on the table. We frankly did not believe her. She offered us a lousy table at the back which we declined. We were put in the embarassing position of having to walk out of the lobby bar, although were were paying guests of the hotel. My wife heard the waitress laughing with another server as we walked out. The concierge was no help at all. Overall though a beautiful hotel and very well located. I would probably return in the future.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 21 2008\\tFive Star Trump!!\\tThe Trump Tower is still under construction and will be for another year. So to get to the hotel you have to walk through scaffolding. But aside from that the hotel is just as advertised-a five star Trump hotel. The rooms are privately owned condos so they have small functional kitchens. There are no balconies but there are small venting windows that open. Everything in the hotels is a solid 5 star level. The personnel are all over you and are very professional. The hotel location is at the foot of the Magnificent Mile which is great in the day but a little quiet at night. I guess my only criticism of my stay is the view from my room was mostly of an adjacent office building-no lake views. Also at the present time there is no outdoor seating for the restaurant or any other part of the hotel. The health club and pool are indoor and both have a great views of the city. There is also complementary wifi in your hotel room. One of the highlights of my stay is the complementary Nespresso Machine that was in my room with refills supplied daily. If you are not familiar with this machine, it makes coffee a cup at the time by putting in a small capsule containing different types of real, not instant, coffee. So when you get up in the morning, turn on the machine, plug in a coffee capsule, and in about 30 seconds you have a cup of freshly brewed coffee or espresso. I loved it so much I ordered the machine while I was there. So my summary is that the hotel is a true 5 star hotel with a Trump touch of class and I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in downtown Chicago.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Aug 17 2008 \\tTrump Hotel an Experience in Itself\\tMy first time to Chicago and we stayed at the Trump Hotel. The hotel was the best part of the trip. The staff was so attentive and made us feel so extraordinary. In a day when customer service is at a low, Trump Hotel excels. Every time we walked in the door it was held open and we were greeted by all of the staff. The room was always so clean and our turndown service made us feel special. Every little detail from the T.V. in the mirror to the espresso maker was above and beyond. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Especially people like myself who would not think that they could afford a hotel like this. Trump hotel made paupers like ourselves feel like royalty in a lavish palace. Thanks Donald. Job well done :)\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 15 2008\\tDonald - You can't be Trumped!\\tWe checked in after a 23hr haul from South Africa and immediately we felt like we &quot;had arrived&quot;!I cannot agree with the other reviews here as we found the Receptionists and the Concierge people especially, very efficient &amp; friendly.Our room had a city view but we were on the 24th floor which was great. The room was decorated in a truly modern style with large 42&quot; HD flatscreen TV + Bose audio on the bedside. Trump goes out of its way to provide all the essentials and a huge array of hotel creature comforts. The piece-de-resistance must surely be the beautiful huge bed/mattress and the most lavish pillows. Our first night's sleep was so good we only woke up after midday.They must have taken heed of previous comments concerning the late housekeeping, but during our entire 5-day stay they were most attentive and punctual.The Spa + Pool are a delight as well as the well-equipped gym - we could have stayed on for another week!We have to congratulate Donald Trump &amp; Bill Rancic on a 7-Star experience. We doubt we could afford the normal rack rates, but because of the building works we got a summer discount which made it possible for us to experience this lifestyle as well as the most beautiful city in USA!

       " \"Aug 12 2008 \\tNot Yet Ready for Prime Time But Almost!\\tWe enjoyed a lovely anniversary weekend in Chicago. God I love that city! We stayed at the new Trump International Towers perfectly located at the south end of N Michigan Avenue at the river. The hotel has only been open for a few months and it has a few minor wrinkles to iron out, but all in all it was a lovely experience. Our hotel of choice is usually The Peninsula, and while The Trump is not equal to our venerable favorite, it did come close in many ways. We had a very large room with a large sitting area and a kitchenette with a fabulous view of the river and Lake Michigan from the 23rd floor. The suite was decorated in muted shades of grey with dark furniture and mohair upholstered pieces. The bathroom was very big with a lovely deep porcelain soaker tub and a separate glassed shower. Despite the generous size of the bathroom, it was curious that the vanity only had one sink, rather than two. Also of note was that in a hotel of this caliber, the kleenex and toilet paper were cheap, one ply products. Also, surprisingly, there wasn't a full length mirror in the suite! Amenities were excellent and top quality, as were the linens, furnishings and electronics. High speed wireless Internet access was fast and free. They had serious elevator problems which they were trying to deal with throughout our visit. Service was ahem, uneven. On Saturday at 3:00 p.m. housekeeping had not visited our room, despite our early 8:30 a.m. departure. The service in Rebar (great name for a bar and a bar with a great river view) was horrible and required frequent gesticulations to enquire about our appetizers (they'd been forgotten), or a second drink, or the requested glass of ice. The service at breakfast was equally abysmal. We were only one of three occupied tables but the blase waitress made mistakes on all of our orders, forgetting items, or getting details incorrect. No coffee or water refills were offered either. The concierges also varied in skill. One woman didn't have a clue about anything we asked her (and she even gave us incorrect directions - turn left which should have been right), but thankfully a young man came to her rescue and saved the day with a fantastic lunch recommendation. The door and front desk staff and all the staff we encountered in the hallways as well as housekeeping, (other than on Saturday) were terrific. Would we return? Yes, we would. We have faith they'll get the kinks out.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 7 2008 \\tGood hotel needs to sort out the service\\tStayed in a suite, great room, amazing view and very well fitted out. But still seems to be full of teething problems in the service. Reception is veruy slow and always seems overwhelmed by the number of people waiting/calls. Two days running they forgot to make up the room, which is pretty unforgivable at the price. Let's hope they sort the service out, as it has the potential to be the best hotel in Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 4 2008 \\tClassic Trump- loved the hotel\\tAlthough Chicagoans may be hesitant about accepting the Trump Tower as part of the architectural fabric of the city, it is a terrific hotel with a great location. We frequent 4 Seasons or equivalent in most cities, and have very high expectations and taste. The Trump Hotel in Chicago exceeded our expectations, even while being constructed (which did not interfere with our visit at all). From a warm welcome by Stephanie, to very attentive staff, including terrific doormen, we were very impressed. The rooms are very comfortable and modern- check out the mirror with a tv in it- very cool. We had adjoining rooms with our twin teenagers, who gave the hotel two thumbs up! When we return to Chicago, the Trump Hotel will be in our plans.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Aug 3 2008 \\tFantastic hotel at perfect location - but reception staff not up to scratch\\tStayed 2 nights at the hotel. Nice luxury but small mistakes allover. Room not cleaned until after 5pm in afternoon. Front desk staff seemed to be a little out of focus and did not pay attention to your questions or needs.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 30 2008 \\tCool Hotel\\tWe stayed in a one-bedroom suite which easily accommodated our two children as well as ourselves (about 1100 sq.ft.) and was about the same cost as two rooms in other hotels. The hotel interiors are high quality, using modern material and contemprary furniture and fittings. The colour schemes were generally in the taupe/cream/beige/brown (crisp white bed linen) neutral range with zebra wood and steel used as accents throughout. Limestone bathrooms had perfect grouting and mastic lines - this project was really well managed to get that level of detailed finish. The overall impression was high quality reserved modern rather than bling.The sound proofing between the living room and the bedroom was excellent. The suite has two bathrooms - which speeds up the morning rituals, especially when travelling with girls! Our whole experience of the hotel was excellent. Other reviews have noted the high end kitchen fitting, bathroom fittings and audio visual equipment - so no more has to be said on that front. The airconditioning was very quiet, coming from a county that does not use A/C generally - it is helpful to have a very quiet system when one is trying to sleep.Any time we went to the pool - we had it to ourselves and maybe one other person. The pool has no real deep end which would suit small children who do not like diving. The view from the pool area is down the river to the lake and also towards the Loop. I did feel that the exposed surface finish on the pool area ceiling was very like fire-safeing used on steel work, and could have been upgraded to a more decorative finish. The changing room was high quality with all the accessories one would need.Signage between the pool/exercise area and the changing rooms might need to be upgraded because when I was waiting for my small daughter to finish her shower, out came an unclad man from the sauna - who tried to convince me that we were in the mens room - luckly I noticed the womens products on the counter top previously so I knew we were in the right room! I drew his attention to that fact and he left and she was none the wiser.Check-in &amp; out were really quick. The staff were always so helpful and friendly. Housekeeping was a bit slow on a couple of occassions in that the room has not been made up by mid afternoon, even though we would have been out of the room since early in the morning.The construction work didn't really affect our stay. We did notice the noise of the lift when we went back to our room mid afternoon. There was no noise after 5pm. There is scaffolding at ground level but there still are clear walkways to the varoius streets. The windows are a bit dirty given the work proceeding at high level, but again nothing that would really affect one's stay.I would recommend this hotel to any catagory of guest - however do book in soon to avail of a five star hotel at affordable prices.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 17 2008 \\tbest hotel in america\\tstay anywhere else in chicago and you'll be making a mistake. pick a category and this hotel has it knocked. there was nothing to complain about. loved every minute of it. the room was outstanding and the service was even better. they are the best and treat everyone like a celebrity. way to go donald, you rule.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jul 12 2008 \\tExtrordinary Hotel\\tThe Trump Hotel Chicago is amazing! Our room was more like an elegant condominium rather than a hotel room. The fully equipped kitchenette was a nice touch. The health club is out of this world with high-end equipment. For some reason, cell phone service was very poor in this building...many of my collegues had the same issue.This is THE hotel to stay in when visiting Chicago.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 11 2008 \\tGreat hotel great location\\tMy wife, 3 month old son, and i stayed at the Trump for 3 nights. It shouldn't make any difference, but the building is still under construction. This didn't impact the hotel at all other than the scaffolding outside the building. No noise or other inconvenience. I've stayed in only a few other really high end hotels and this was definitely the best. The staff was very friendly and greeted my son by name several times. The room was huge (600sf) and had all sorts of neat &quot;extras&quot; (42&quot; LCD tv, tv build into the bathroom mirror, fully stocked kitchenette with very nice items, Bose clock-radio with iPod dock, electric curtains), very comfortable bed. Bath products are top notch. My wife said &quot;this is the first hotel I've been where I wasn't skeeved out about the sheets and never saw a single hair in the bathroom.&quot; The only complaints, and you have to take them in reference to the hotel being 5 star, are that there were some marks on the walls as if luggage had rubbed, and the turn down service never returned one day and had to be called the 2nd day. Minor issues for sure, but if you're talking about a 5 star hotel, that's a high standard. I'd definitely recommend it, but I also have to say we got a very good price of about $300 per night. I don't think I'd pay the usual rate of $450 or more per night for ANY hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 10 2008 \\tLoved the hotel HATED THE RACIST DOORMAN.\\tWe recently stayed at the Trump hotel in June. I am originally from Chicago, and we wanted to visit our family who live further north, on Lake Shore Drive. We got a river view suite, and I think it was about $500.00 a night.I have to say the hotel is STUNNING!!!!!! Our initial room was great, but noisy (there is still ongoing construction). The front desk at the Trump obliged in giving us a new room, and it was breathtaking. Everything is very modern and new (and in keeping with the sleek modernity that you would see at hotels like the Mercer in NYC--sleek, but not overwhelming or intimidating). The room had the BEST Chicago view--Navy Pier and the Chicago River and it was mostly unobstructed and endless. And a real bonus was that the windows open just a bit--we are sticklers for fresh air. That allowed just enough air in without there being a hazard for those of you with small children.The room (one bedroom apartment?) was clean, and roomy and had everything you could want (we had a suite that had two full baths with absolute top of the line fixtures--amenities like a television in the mirror (I want that for home!), marble showers AND separate baths. There was a full kitchen with top of the line appliances (Miele dishwasher, for example, and also free Nespresso), which would be a real bonus for families for children.Speaking of children, when we notified the hotel that we would have a baby visiting us for the day, they immediately put not only a great crib in our room, but a high chair, a diaper genie and soap and lotion, etc. for the baby. We really appreciated that gesture.The swimming pool is also great for kids, and they are very friendly there and will provide swimming noodles and amenities for those with small children. Adjacent to the swimming pool (btw with a breathtaking view), the Spa/Fitness room is absolutely top of the line--brand new and plentiful equipment, Pilates classes, and fresh water (fruit infused and bottled. The last day we were there they replaced the bottled water with Trump Ice water, which had a picture of Donald Trump on it. We thought it very funny!). It is so neat to exercise in a great location (high up overlooking all of Chicago).The restaurant, however, is a work in progress. The staff was not yet fully trained, the water tasted like chlorine (and they kept trying to fill my glass with it, even though we had bottled water), and the menu was HORRIBLY expensive ($50.00 for an entree), but not inspired. We actually had a hard time trying to figure out what to order, because nothing sounded interesting enough to pay for. Before we were finished, it was clear they wanted us to leave, and started to fold linens in our vicinity, which seems strange when you are paying $400.00 for dinner. But the view is great.However, the fact that I liked the hotel as much as I did makes me sad to continue this review and end up only giving this hotel 3 stars. The first incident that blew our minds was what will be known in our family as the &quot;racist doorman incident&quot;. On the early afternoon of Friday, June 20th, it began to rain, just as my family stopped by to pick us up for lunch. Earlier in the day, I had gone out and it had rained, and I asked for an umbrella at the first counter where the doorpersons are stationed. They happily obliged (one person was a nice older African American woman with braids). I returned the umbrella as we came in, and thought nothing of it.At about 1p.m., however, when I asked for two umbrellas (we were now a motley group of 4 toddlers, and 6 adults without an umbrella amongst us), the same woman manning the door attempted to go behind the desk and retrieve them, but the man behind the counter, looked at us, stopped her, and said, We are all out of umbrellas. If you need an umbrella, you will have to go up to your room to get one. Fair enough. We understood that if it was raining, umbrellas may be in limited supply. My husband went upstairs to get an umbrella. But in the meantime, the same man behind the counter took out all these new umbrellas and started unwrapping them! They were there all along!What was more HUMILIATING was that he came from behind the counter, and gave an umbrella each to two white women who hadnt even left the lobby, and HADN'T EVEN ASKED FOR THEM YET! I was shocked, but I was actually more humiliated. Both my 4 year old daughter and my 65 year old mother asked me why the man said there were no more umbrellas, when clearly there were. How could I tell my daughter there were no more umbrellas for people like us?! Did he not like us because we were the wrong color, or because he didn't think we were worthy of the hotel? I have my suspicions, but don't you think that was awful??!? At least the African American co-worker, who was clearly embarrassed, then proceeded to go behind the counter and give us all umbrellas. But he really ruined my day and I felt really low. I thought about why he would do such a thing in front of my family all day.That same day, at 8:30 I went down to ReBar, their signature bar (that they tout as serving exotic cocktails) for a quick cocktail with my sister. I felt we were both dressed well (she was in a summer dress and I was in a pucci dress). When we sat down, a waitress came to us and said, &quot;I'm sorry, but this table is bottle service only after 9:00pm). My sister responded that it was only 8:30. The waitress served us, but you could tell she wasn't happy about it. I can tell you that we looked like everyone else in the bar (the bar, btw, skews middle-aged and distinctly suburban; I definitely was one of the younger people there). My sister, who already had the &quot;umbrella&quot; incident, started talking about how she felt uncomfortable being there, and so as soon as the drink came, we took it upstairs. But the kicker is that my husband and myself came back an hour and half later, and guess what? The couple now sitting in the same seats we had earlier occupied was just drinking simple cocktails!!!! Where was the bottle service?!?!? Beats me.Initially, I was willing to believe that these two incidents were an aberration and that there is no pattern. No one wants to accuse a hotel of something like casual racism in this day and age. But after speaking with the manager, I am not so sure. They say all behaviors emanate from the top, and if this is the case, I have to say the manager could do a better job at dispelling my suspicions.When I wrote the manager about this, both he (T. Colm OCallaghan) and his assistant manager (Jerome) tried repeatedly to contact me. I assumed that they were contacting me to apologize, but what actually ended up happening is that Mr. O'Callaghan at first apologized, and then tried to intimate that I had misread the situation. He kept trying to tell me that what happened didn't happen!!!! He said they simply ran out of umbrellas! HELLO??!! I was there!!! They NEVER ran out of umbrellas, the guy just didn't want to give us the umbrellas he had! He kept trying to spin it as a misunderstanding, but this guy just didn't want to waste his dwindling resources (umbrellas) on the likes of us.As for the bar incident, he said that certain areas have bottle service after a certain hour. But when I told him that hour hadn't been reached (she didn't want to serve us at 8:30pm because she said bottle service starts at 9), and when I came back an hour and half later, the people now sitting at the same seats were just having cocktails, he didn't want to talk about it. Weird. Instead of diffusing the situation, he made me feel as if he didn't want to hear what really happened, and that he thought I was a silly deluded person.So in the end, this hotel gets 3 stars: 5 stars for the hotel, amenities (spa/swimming pool/fitness center), view and most of the staff, and one or none for the racist doorman, waitress (?), and pretty insensitive manager. The restaurant was also not so great.\\t\\n\",\n",

Enjoyed beverages at Rebar. Bathroom amenities were great and loved the in mirror HD TV. I do prefer totally separate shower and tub but this was a nice design.

       " \"Jul 8 2008 \\tWarning - theft from room - protect your property\\tOur stay at Trump Chicago started off as one of our favourite Chicago experiences. The room was fantastic and the front line staff exceptional. We were so pleased with the hotel and its facilities that after our second day, we decided we would like to make this our &quot;go to&quot; hotel in Chicago. This all changed on our third day. While getting ready for dinner, my wife realized that she could not find her new designer shoes that she brought along. She knew exactly where she had left them the night before, however, after a very thorough search, they failed to turn up. We contacted the front desk, and while at dinner, the room was checked again by hotel staff and security without success, and it was determined that her shoes were &quot;removed&quot; from the room while we were out earlier that day.Although you might think that this in itself was enough to turn us off the hotel, it was how the managment handled (or lack of) the situation. We were told that we would be contacted by the &quot;Director of Front Office&quot; the following morning and he was in a postion to resolve this matter. We waited most of the next morning to be contacted by Paul &quot;S&quot;, and after leaving 3 messages for him we were informed by security that he was &quot;too busy to deal with this situation&quot;. OK...lets get this straight - the Manager of a five star hotel is too busy to deal with the theft of a guests personal belongings from the room? Are you serious? Motel 6 offers better trained managers (I've never really stayed at Motel 6), and we have yet to hear from anyone regarding this matter.The Trump Hotel offers guests a fantastic experience and its design and dedication of the front line staff need to be noted. The management however is an embarrasment to the Trump name and should get the &quot;YOUR FIRED!&quot;\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 7 2008 \\tExcellent splurge weekend\\tAfter a two-night stay at the Trump to celebrate a special occasion, my wife and I now have a new favorite hotel for our getaways from the suburbs to downtown Chicago. Over the years we've tried a lot of the major hotels...the Four Seasons, Peninsula, Park Hyatt, Ritz, Sofitel, Drake, and others...and while they're all nice, we think the Trump has the most going for it. First of all, the location is perfect: just a block off of the Magnificent Mile, an easy few blocks to the center of the Loop or to River North galleries and nightlife, and a very nice stroll to Millennium Park or the lakefront. It's in the middle of everything but still above most of the city noise (two sides of the building are more or less bordered by water). The views of the lake, river, and/or city are unbeatable.Everyone we encountered on the staff was friendly, hospitable, and surprisingly unpretentious...including at the top-notch restaurant Sixteen. For such a classy property, the snoot factor was really low which made it all the more relaxing.And our room was extremely comfortable. Lots of elbow room, high ceilings, huge windows, a great bed, and unbelievably, every room has at least a small kitchen; ours had a fridge/freezer/ice maker, sink, dishwasher, microwave, and cooktop. Our bellman said that some guests actually do bring in food and cook in, a touch of home that we did not take advantage of but if we had kids with us that kitchen could have come in very handy.Although the building construction is continuing way above the hotel space, you really couldn't tell; the only things that gave it away were the scaffolding over the front entrance and the occasional lifting or lowering of building materials way up on the ~90th floor. (At one point we saw a construction Porta Potty being hoisted past our 20th floor window which was a little disconcerting, but that's it.)We had a perfect getaway and will definitely look forward to returning to the Trump. But for now it's back to real life...\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 6 2008 \\tBest location in Chicago\\tI wanted to try this new luxury property in Chicago. I've stayed at the Peninsula, the Four Seasons, and the Park Hyatt (and other lesser rated properties) and I was looking forward to comparing the Trump to these fine accommodations.First, the good. Location, location, location! By far the best feature of the hotel is its scenic perch on the river, close to the Michigan Avenue scene AND the loop stuff like Millenium Park and the Art Institute. Right now it is a bit tough to find and walk around because of ongoing construction, but this should be no problem when it is finished.Second, even the standard rooms are huge. I was on the 24th floor in a 'city view' deluxe room. The view was forgettable, but the quality of the interior was impressive. I especially liked the high end ktichenette with a microwave, SubZero fridge, Meile stove, etc. There are even cooking utensils, pans, and dishes!Now, the not so good. Even though the room is large and luxurious, I found it a bit sterile. The slate color scheme should be brightened up a bit with a dash of red roses or something else to break up the slate monotony. The duvet on the bed was very thick and the a/c didn't seem to work so well so it was a bit stuffy. I took a tour of the spa and fitness center, but didn't partake of any service or activity. I had no meals at the hotel either.The one downside of my stay was the construction noise that started early in the morning. I know that I paid a soft opening rate of $347 because of the construction, but I had hoped that there would be a minimal amount of noise. Not so -- they were pumping concrete up to the 90th floor and there was a 5 second interval pounding in the core of the hotel that did not stop. When I checked out, I told the front desk person about this, and she apologized. I actually checked out early because the pounding was so annoying.All in all, the Trump is a fine choice for Chicago, but if you are looking for lavish, extensive public areas and a bit of warmth in the guest rooms, I'd suggest the Four Seasons or Peninsula.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 23 2008\\tWonderful Hotel!\\tMy husband and I just stayed 3 nights at the Trump International and as many have said, it did NOT disappoint. Although the first room we were in had quite a bit of construction noise, I asked if there were anything else, and they immediately moved us to the opposite side of the hotel where we had a wonderful river view. We had a Deluxe river room which was lovely. My husband said that he was &quot;in trouble&quot; because I was so spoiled by the ammenities and service, that I will never be satisfied with a &quot;regular&quot; hotel again. The staff were wonderful. Unobtrusive but able to quickly answer any question we had. They ALWAYS had doors open for us when we were coming and going. One thing that set this hotel apart was that we always felt that we were given individual service as opposed to &quot;what's best for the masses&quot;.Can't wait to return! I hope we can afford it after it is completed!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 15 2008 \\tTrump Tower - Chicago's best hotel ?\\tWe have just completed our third stay Trump and felt compelled to pass along our highest praises for this exciting addition to Chicago's hotel scene - The staff at Trump are very professional and friendly you would think the hotel had been open for years then you look up and see the cranes still working on the upper floors - The construction is not an issue but it will be great when they are able to open the outdoor areas of the restaurant and river walk - Anyway for us who have stayed numerous times at the Penninsula and the 4 Seasons we now have a new favorite hotel in Chicago , it.s just more fun @ Trump . Great job to the management and all employees that make this such an exciting new hotel - I can't wait for all the finishing touches to be completed at which time I think universal praise will place Trump at the top of the list for luxury hotels in Chicago !!!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 14 2008 \\tWeekend without children\\tWe stayed at the hotel for a weekend - leaving the kids behind at home so we were just looking for a nice relaxing weekend.The hotel was great. I was expecting over the top luxury but instead found it very understated and modern.Besides the scaffolding at the entrance there is no other evidence of construction.Contrary to some of the other reviewers opinion I found the staff very attentive and courteous. They're not in your face, but they're there if you need something.I am about 6 months pregnant and I was asked if there was anything they could do to help me with any cravings to just give them a call.The rooms are huge and very convenient. Wonderful shower, wonderful bed, the kitchenette is helpful.The concierge was helpful and was even able to get us last minute tickets to shows (albeit at a very inflated price)Room service however was very disappointing. I didn't order the 1000$ Trump dinner menu (yes, 1000$!) but the food I ordered twice was well below average.Location of the hotel was great. It's walking distance to almost everything and the building is so tall that even with my bad sense of direction I could always find my way back.There's also a wonderful restaurant called Vermilion just a 1 minute walk from the hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 13 2008 \\tThe Trump didn't disappoint\\tWhen you're paying the kind of rates that are charged at a hotel of this caliber you expect a certain level of quality and service. The Trump didn't disappoint in either area. We stayed here to celebrate my husband's birthday for 2 fabulous days in what is literally an apartment that is arguably located in one of the best areas of the city. We walked to Navy Pier, the Lake, and Michigan Ave. shopping to name a few city hot spots. Because the Trump sits on a bend in the Chicago River it has a fantastic vantage point. We had a suite with floor to ceiling windows that showcased a view of the river and Lake Michigan. Unfortunately, the building's upper floors were still under construction during our stay and the windows were in need of a wash. However, other than the dirty windows and a little water dripping off the overhead construction scaffolding set up at the hotel's entrance, we were never disturbed by the construction. The accomodations are top of the line everything. Good linens, very comfortable bed and robes and slippers are provided. I like this touch. The suites have a full kitchen that comes complete with espresso maker, hot water kettle (I drink tea and really appreciated this extra), dishes, glassware, silverware, pots and pans, a full refrigerator, dishwasher etc. The suite we reserved had a dining table that seated 8 and a large, comfortable living room with flat panel TV, Bose Ipod docking station and a desk/work area with unlimited free internet. We felt like we were staying at a friend's very luxurious apartment. The bedroom was separate from the living area with its own bath complete with waterfall tub, separate rain shower and two sinks. There was also a powder room located off the living area. This was great for our needs because we had guests come up to our suite after we hosted a small party in the Grand Salon, one of the Trump's banquet rooms. Our private party experience also went beyond my expectations. The Grand Salon has a modern zen elegance, the food was simply gourmet all the way, the service was impeccable and there was that amazing view again. The event planner was professional and handled the smallest details efficiently. The only small disappointment was the bartender. He didn't seem to know how to mix certain drinks, but this could have been a result of the bar only being stocked with certain liquors. We didn't take advantage of the spa, but did use the fitness center which was also top of the line. The treadmills actually had aromatherapy fans! Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially for a special occasion. It certainly made our celebration more memorable.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 11 2008 \\tLoved the Trump\\tI brought my daughter to the Trump to celebrate her 19th birthday. She was in for a surprise because she thought we were staying at the Hyatt. I let the hotel know it was her birthday and upon check in, they wished her a Happy Birthday. We had a standard room but it was beautiful and modern. We had a nice city view and loved the mini kitchen. We also loved the espresso machine! After getting settled into our room, as we were putting things away, room service showed up with a small birthday cake that was a raspberry mouse-very nice touch! We did a lot of sightseeing for three days and although the weather was not that great, we loved being able to just walk around on Michigan Avenue, take the free trolley over to Navy Pier and catching cabs here and there. We went to Cafe Babareba the first night and loved it (great flavored sangria), saw Blue Man Group (for the 3rd time but still loved it), shopped on Michigan Avenue (very convenient to the hotel), had lunch at Giordanos and one day on the 95th floor of the John Hancock building, had dinner at N9ne (maybe a little overrated but ok), and went to the Field Museum. After shopping on Saturday, we did go to the pool area and loved it! Aside from a beautiful view and lovely, serene setting, they have the Kohler shower you see on TV with all of the body sprays that even has different colored settings. We also enjoyed the steam and dry saunas, and they even have a small bathing suit water extractor - very cool! We went to Rebar one evening and I enjoyed a raspberry champagne while she enjoyed being in a trendy setting for a bit.All in all we loved our stay there. We saw a family pull up in a rolls royce, and tourists in jeans and t-shirts and I think everyone was treated the same which was refreshing considering some high end places have employees that act as if they're better than some of the guests! Everyone was super friendly from the front desk staff to the doormen.We'll look forward to staying here again!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jun 9 2008 \\tThe hotel is amazing even the least expensive room is spectacular\\tEven though the hotel is still under construction, besides some work to the hotel drive in area, I did not notice any noise or construction traffic. The reception area is modern and very Trump, and as soon as I stepped out of our sedan we were immediately treated &quot;as royalty.&quot; Our bags were swooped up and our room keys quickly distributed.We had a Deluxe King City View room on the 23rd floor. I believe that this is the smallest and cheapest of the rooms. But as soon as we opened the room to the door, we were blown away. The view to the city is unprecedented, and every detail of the room is upgraded even compared to a luxury hotel. The bathrooms are huge, deep soaking tubs lay adjacent to a rain showerhead and shower area all enclosed in semi-frameless glass doors. THERE IS EVEN A FLAT SCREEN TV IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR!The room was amazing! Simply Spectacular!My wife and I also tried out the Trump Spa, we both booked 90 minute Trump Massages. They were the best massages that we both have ever received. I highly recommend the Trump Massage. And arrive a little early so you can enjoy the other Spa amenities and the relaxing lounge area.The location is also perfect, right in downtown just a few blocks from the best shopping in Chicago.I highly recommend this hotel and I hope that the rates do not go up too much once construction finishes so that I can come back for my next trip to Chicago.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jun 9 2008 \\tAwesome\\tFrom when you check in to when you check out you will be treated like Donald himself.Visited Chicago for a weekend in April. Weather was perfect and the hotel could not have been any better. We got upgraded to a suite over looking the river and the lake. They are still building the upper floors but you would not have known unless you looked up. The spa is a great experience. Just the pool and shower alone is worth the short elevator ride.Sixteen is the best meal I have had in a long time. I highly suggest the tasting menu. Worth every penny.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 2 2008 \\tCrisp and Modern Reasuringly Nonpretentious HUGE ROOMS!\\tBooked a room at the Chicago Trump on Valentine's Day. The hotel hadn't officially opened yet, and so scored a great rate on the grand deluxe 1-bedroom suite. To be honest I really wanted to hate this hotel, but upon my night's stay I have to admit that it is instantly competitive with Chicagos finest five-star properties. The lobby is small and, check-in was quite pleasant. Readily available employees everywhere you look, but nonintrusive at the same time. Decor is very pleasant- very minimalist and modern, and everywhere you look there are panoramic views of the Chicago skyline, river and lake Michigan. Suite was HUGE. 1,000+ SQ feet, could have entertained 60-70 easily. Floor to ceiling windows with fabulous views (see pix) and great full kitchen with everything youd need to make five-star meal (they actually offer in-room chef service). Recommend both Sixteen and ReBar for views and food that compete with other fine dining establishments as well as hotel bars. Cant wait for Sixteens patio to open summer of 2009.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 27 2008 \\tHoped for more at this high end Trump Hotel\\tMy husband and I stayed at Trump for our 5th wedding anniversary this past weekend. I had high expectations, however many of them were not met based on the ratings of the hotel. We live in the suburbs of Chicago and are well traveled. The Pro's:Location is fabulous; especially if you are not from Chicago you can walk to just about everything and the cab rides are short if you prefer to take one.The room is gorgeous! The bed is one of the best we've ever stayed in and the mini-full kitchen was great for heating up our left overs the next day. We found the amenities to be well thought out and well appointed. Plus the touches like framed photos in the room were very chic and homey at the same time.You will never find a better bathrobe in your life. They accommodated our bikes which we drove in with to do a biking event and kept safely down near the security office. No problems.The Con's:We booked an elaborate VIP spa package; the massages were about a 6/10 in quality (but that is subjective, I'm sure) and the fancy baths that were drawn for us could have cooked a lobster they were so hot. I had to run ice cold water in it for 5 minutes straight to make it manageable - and for $550 for this treatment, I didn't expect to have to draw my own bath. Very disappointing.The service was...cool. No one was rude or impolite, but as I mentioned before we stayed for 2 nights in a deluxe room for our 5 year anniversary and despite wanting to know the special reason for our stay when we booked the room, they did nothing with this information. For touting this level of service, we were both disappointed that no effort was made to go above and beyond. Faulty charges were on our room with little to apologize or compensate for us catching the $160 error.Overall, I won't be running back to spend this kind of cash at this facility. The restaurant at Sixteen is stunning, although we did not dine there. The excitement of being at a Trump facility left something to be desired, as we expected more from this high class hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 27 2008 \\tWill definitely be back\\tStayed at the Tump Tower over holiday weekend. I traveled with my husband and my 8 month old son. Absolutely loved the property - the rooms are spacious and the kitchenette is indispensable when traveling with a young child. Staff was extremely accommodating especially at the restaurant Sixteen. Whether in town for business or pleasure, I will stay here again given the property's perfect location, spacious rooms and excellent service.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 27 2008 \\tPerfect for children!\\tWe just returned from a weekend stay with our 2 year old for our 10th wedding anniversary. The hotel was the perfect luxury accomodations that you would expect. Complimentary champagne and chocolate strawberries were waiting for us in our room. The hotel staff was completely attentive and every little detail was covered when it came to our child. The room was equipped with a real crib, diaper genie, high chair, baby bath products ( including rubber duckies) and a stuffed animal for him to keep. For us adults, the extra large suite allowed us to have our own space while traveling with a toddler. The pool was great also with swim diapers and baby toys. The restaurant was gorgeous and completely accomodating. There is a little cosmetic disadvantage with the construction still going on above and the street noise was not completely filtered but it was worth it. Perfect stay with no complaints.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'May 20 2008 \\tGreat Hotel but Weak Service\\tGreat new hotel in Chicago, my first time there. I have to say that the rooms are big and nice interior but the hotel service really lacks. Not what you expect from a five star hotel, most staff not very friendly and for some reason alot of staff dont know basic information about anything. The best part of the stay was though when the concierge booked us a restaurant which has been closed for 4 months, really funny to get to the place and there is nothing there. Otherwise a really good stay, hope the service improves.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'May 20 2008 \\tThe best hotel in Chicago?\\tAfter having stayed in this great hotel I am not surpised that all the reviews for it are so good. Our room was huge with great views. The service was excellent. To summarise, a really wonderfull hotel which is of an equal standard of the 4 Seasons.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'May 19 2008 \\tPretty Great\\tHad an incredible stay this week.The hotel is almost complete with construction and Is absolutely beautiful.Upon check in we had requested and booked adjoining rooms.We were shown to the room and It wasnt adjoining.We had even asked them at the desk to confirm this and It still wasnt correct.However the bellman was so professional and offered us to sit in the room and offered to make us coffee while we waited for the desk to find our correct rooms.The rooms were located and simply perfect.The rooms are very modern and HUGE.They each have mini sub zero and miele dishwasher(not sure why anyone needs this,but Its great)The room also had a super easy espresso machines for a quick cup in the mornings.The bathrooms are awesome and my favorite part.The typical TV in mirror that you see at most upscale hotels these days(finally put one in at home)The shower and bathtub is side by side behind a glass wall.The lighting and drapes are all controlled electonically and easy to operate.The flat screen TV didnt work and the maintenence dept. came directly up with a new TV and were efficient and and quick with the installation.The staff is well trained and always greet you with a &quot;Welcome back&quot;each time you return.I booked a massage a was a bit disappointed.A female should always have another female show her around the spa.With that in mind,I checked in for the massage and had a very nice man show me to the door of the ladies locker room and went away.I was alone in the locker and didnt have a robe in my locker and had to get completely dressed to go back to the desk to ask where to get the robe.It was a little eerie in the locker because I was completely alone with NOBODY around. Ater a mediocre massage I was shown back to the door of the locker room.When walking back to the showers I had to weave around a group of people being given a tour of the spa,with the group of business people in suits.Those of you people who get massages understand how you look after the treatment.I felt very uncomfortable. I dont know maybe thats just me.The hotel is amazing and you wont be disappointed.Go soon before It stays booked year round as It surely will.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Apr 18 2008 \\tThis Place is Awesome!\\tI stayed at Chicao's newest luxury hotel in March, and was absolutely blown away. Not being a huge Donald Trump fan, I was sketical until the moment I walked in the lobby, when I knew this place was special.Although the 93 story building was not yet complete, the Hotel had just opened, as it occupies only the bottom (now completed) 30 floors.From the staff at check in, to the 600 + sqft standard rooms, everything was first class all the way...ever seen a Sub-Zero mini-fridge? All fine Italian furniture, Bose CD player on nightstand, IPOD doc, flat screen TV's, including one in the bathroom mirror!Also full kitchens with Milet stove, dishwasher, even plates, forks, and knives...and I was in a standard room! The views of the river, and lake are nothing short of spectacular, and as a frequent visitor to Chicago, I can say with some authority that there is no hotel in the Chicago with views like this, and no upscale hotel with all the modern ammentities this one has...and did I mention the rooms are huge!The rates are still low considering, until construction is complete in 2009, and I definitely felt like I was getting a great deal, even though I was still paying $300 a night...the rates supposed to go to $500 a night soon, so make sure to take advantage of Chicago's newest gem, with the best location in the city!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 15 2008 \\tAn amazing experience!\\tI had the pleasure of staying here for a weekend in April - after a weeks training outside Chicago. It was a truly enjoyable experience. I stayed in a double room with a kichen (inc dishwasher, fridge freezer, coffee machine etc) on the 27th floor overlooking the river. The views were spectacular and the room very spacious. Room facilities included a large bathroom (inc TV in the mirror), luxurious bathrobes, Plasma tv, iPod docking station, comfortable bed, desk with stationery supplies, and beautiful interior design.Customer service in the hotel was excellent. Overall the staff were friendly, approachable and professional. I would recommend a visit to the spa on the 14th floor where I enjoyed the Trump Classic Massage. Also the restaurant '16' on the 16th floor served delicious food (the sampliing menu is recommended) with wonderful views.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 25 2008 \\tYou have to do this\\tI had the opportunity to stay at the Trump for the evening of the 9th of Feburary. We were on the 17th floor with a standard room. The Room layout is great we had several people in the room to celebrate my Niece's birthday. We had a King Size bed with a sleeper sofa. Not everyone spent the night but at one point we had 5 grown woman and 2 toddlers in the room and never felt cramped. There was a 2 burner electric stove along with a dishwasher and sub zero mini fridge. The bathroom is the best there is a soaking tub that is out of this world. There is a television recessed into the mirror that you can view from the tub. The bathroom amenites are top notch. They offer slippers and an umbrella in your hall closet and the closet in the bedroom is huge by most hotel standards.The bed was so comfortable and even the sofa bed was not bad. The room had a flat screen tv and a huge dresser that can double as a buffet when you are serving guests. They have an awsome array of serving pieces in the kitchenette. The staff is wonderful, we laughed that we never opened a door for ourselves. The staff is well trained and show pride in their work. I think everyone we encountered really enjoyed their job. They had a sense of pride to being working at such a great hotel.The only drawbacks we found were that the walls are flat paint and when the little ones touched the walls they left some prints. Also in the kichen area there is flat paint and as people reheat food or cook this could be a future problem. The pans are truely gourmet and if you do not have oil there is a huge sticking factor.The room was not as child friendly as other places, but this is the TRUMP so move the objects of art to a higher location.We will be back....if you can splurge a little go for a one bedroom suite. You get a full HUGE bedroom, 2 bathrooms and a full kitchen with a living room.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 18 2008 \\tTake advantage of this amazing value while it lasts!\\tWe live in downtown Chicago but decided to do a mini-getaway at the Trump because the prices are roughly half what they will be when construction is finished and we wanted to experience it ourselves. We had a standard room which is generously proportioned (about 650 sq. ft.). It came equipped with a large flat panel HDTV and a flat panel TV built into the bathroom mirror - very cool little feature. All rooms also have a kitchenette with Sub Zero mini fridge, a full size Miele dishwasher, 2 burner Miele cook top, a microwave, and all the cookware, utensils and service items you need. The fridge is nicely furnished, but the attentive staff will customize it with whatever food and beverages you like. The room was nicely laid out with a king size bed and a sofa sleeper. Wireless internet and local calls are included in the price. The robes are plush and the Trump slippers are a good touch. The bathroom is nicely appointed with high quality toiletries, and a unique granite shower/tub combo with rain shower head and a waterfall spout in the tub (which is big enough to lounge in and has a good view of the in-mirror TV). The furnishings and decor in the room and throughout the hotel are highest quality. Very modern with dark woods and unique fixtures. In room there's an iPod docking station, CD player/DVD player, and a good selection of TV stations (even Fox Sports which delighted my British husband). They'll even bring up an X Box if you'd like. We were on the 24th floor and never once heard any construction noise. Even though the hotel is still in soft open, the staff was superb. Friendly, gracious and went out of their way to help. The Trump obviously values service...it seems every corner we turned we encountered a training session. It's clear the staff are proud of the hotel and are quick to give a tour or point out a unique feature. We stayed with our 3 year old son. While this is not a family-oriented hotel, every single staff member went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to accommodate our needs. They loan out strollers and any other baby item you can think of. By the end of the first day every staff member we ran into seemed to greet our son by name. The concierge is a fountain of knowledge. He gave us a dining recommendation that fulfilled our very specific criteria and it was perfect. He, and the rest of the staff, enthusiastically greeted us by name after the first introduction. The restaurant (Sixteen) is now open. The adjoining nightclub Re-Bar isn't open yet, but the bar is set up and serving and there's plenty of seating. As a Chicago native I can tell you -- the view from the restaurant/bar doesn't get any better than this. A beautiful outdoor veranda with circle-around balcony. Fabulous views of the lake, river and nearby historic architecture. This was really well planned. You practically feel like you're sitting under the towers of the Wrigley building. Food and service at the restaurant live up to the expectations of a fine dining experience. The chandelier is amazing, the space is breathtaking.We were fortunate enough to be there for the opening of the fitness center (spa is not open yet). The fitness center is terrific with plenty of equipment including treadmills, ellipticals, spinning room, studios for classes, yoga mats, etc. And all with floor to ceiling views of the skyline, river and lake. The locker rooms are an experience in and of themselves. Again, the staff went out of their way to accommodate and highlight all the features. The pool is a real treat. It just opened -- we have the unique privilege of being able to say we were the FIRST people to swim at the Trump Tower in Chicago. Very serene setting, nicely appointed and, again, with floor-to-ceiling views. There are sure to be a few glitches as they roll out, but they try hard to compensate. We had a strange situation where 3 wine openers in a row broke when we used them (the door man immediately came upstairs with his own personal wine opener that he had with him because a few other guests have had the same problem). Another downfall is the outrageous room service pricing. It's beyond Chicago luxury standards -- even beyond New York standards. We felt compelled to order the $26 cheeseburger, just to see what could possibly justify that price. Alas, it was just a plain, ordinary burger...not even on the big side. And the quality of room service dining was just acceptable, not great. Prices in the restaurant are typical for a 5 star hotel, but much more reasonable than room service.Overall, a great place. I hope they can maintain the standard of attention and service as more guests arrive. But this is a no-brainer -- go while the price is low, it's a truly first rate experience. Compared to other 5 stars we've stayed at like the Palace in NY, the Phoenician and the Four Seasons (all places we love), this actually seems to take luxury a step further.\\t\\n\",\n",

We were really excited about the perfect location, walking distance of everything (including a cheap and amazing bakery for breakfast just north a block on the opposite side of the street ) and after a day of traveling we just wanted to drop off our stuff and start looking at the city.Staff: We arrived and the hotel staff wasn't exactly the most pleasant people but they quickly set us up and we got a one queen bedroom. When we got our key and paid (no refunds by the way) we went to our room and saw that there were NO sheets on the bed. gross. So after telling them they said they didn't have access to the laundry room or linen closet? Long story short we ended up spending the first night with no sheets. haha but we threw on a sweater a cuddled. We're troopers. The next morning after waking up at 6am basically begging and being overly polite we got blankets. A lot of blankets actually. They were clean just covered in some balls of lint. Better then I expected.Strange things: I saw there were pictures of people having fridges and microwaves in their rooms which I asked about. The older lady claimed that they never had those. Ugh. Whatever. Or that none of the rooms have a jacuzzi, which is pictured on the website. The place is a little more 'rustic' then what is pictured on their website.Cleanliness: The carpets were sticky, and there was some dried red stuff in the dresser drawers, and a cigarette burn in the mattress. But no bugs, mold (that I could see) or anything of that caliber. It was a little grimy but even the bathroom wasn't too bad. All very doable for a week. We only got cold water in the shower, but again, not the hugest deal to me. At the end of the day it was just another thing to sort of laugh at. Oh and someone stole the batteries from the tv remote. Location &amp; Cost: I don't think you can beat either. Your close to trains, bus stops, food, touristy things, etc. Next time I visit this amazing city the only thing I'm doing differently is calling ahead and making sure we have sheets!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 5 2009 \\tNever Go Here (Unless You Are Desperate or Can't Afford Anything Else)\\tThis was the worst motel I've ever been too. It was so bad, I Googled it just to find a website to write a review about it to; other people need to know, too. Our bed didn't even have a fitted sheet, just two sheets and a blanket. They wouldn't give us extra pillows or blankets. There was no remote for the t.v. and the t.v. was crap. There was no clock, a radiator in the corner for heat, the blinds did NOTHING to block out sun in the morning, we were very iffy about the door lock, everything was dirty, there wasn't even a toilet paper roll holder, a towel was sitting in the corner behind the toilet, you could either get hot OR cold water in the sink, not both, the bathroom door barley shut, I didn't even wanna try the shower! We could hear other people's doors shutting, the CTA EL ran right past the window, paint was peeling off the walls, oh, and did I mention that everything was dirty? The only clean thing was the bedding, thankfully.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 26 2009 \\tOmg!!!\\tI don't know if this is a hotel or a safe house. The hotel is dirty, there is no front desk or actual check in. When we arrived we told them we had a reservation ,the &quot;front desk clerk&quot; gave us a look as if the word &quot;reservation&quot; sounded foreign to him, after a short explanation of what a reservation was, the hotel clerk decided to warn us and told us to check out the rooms before making a final decision. To say that these rooms are OUTDATED would be a compliment. The only positive thing that i could say about this hotel or ROACHTEL is that is located close to the Wrigley field. don't even consider paying $65 a night because that is just ridiculous. I think people should get paid to stay at this hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 2 2008 \\tNo roaches but no quality either.\\tI stayed with a friend over Halloween weekend, and experienced much the same as other reviewers.At $65 a night, the Sheffield is by far the most affordable hotel in the area. Wrigley Field is a block away, and it's close to the mass transit. Everything else in the area is two or thee times more expensive.However, nothing can positive can be said about the hotel itself. The staff is terrible, and interact with you as if you're not a guest but a necessary evil. They have obscure rules: &quot;No visitors allowed.&quot; &quot;Anything left in the room after 11am of checkout is considered abandoned.&quot; Also, other reviewers mentioned this being a 'transient hotel', and my stay reinforced that idea.The room, while free of insects that other reviews had, was abyssmal. The ceiling had water damage, mold, and there were numerous defects in just about every category.That said, if you're on a tight budget, the Sheffield is a safe hotel with a great location. Just don't expect anything.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Aug 3 2008 \\tPrior Reviews Harsh\\tMy friend and I drove 10 hours to Chicago to go to Lollapalooza and found out that our prievously booked hotel had accidentally cancelled our reservations. Well, after such a long drive and it being 3 in the morning, I was extremely tired and upset and just wanted to find somewhere to stay. Every other hotel was booked, and we were getting desperate. We accidentally stumbled across the House Hotel and asked for a room. The guy was sweet and gave us a two bedroom room for only $70 a night. We walked up the staircase after recieving our key and to our room. It's an older hotel, but pretty well kept. We had cable television, free wi-fi, and an amazing air-conditioner. The train is only about 2 minutes away walking, and you can virtually smoke anywhere in the building.If you're looking for a fancy-shmancy hotel that will burn a hole in your pocket, don't go to the Sheffield House. If you'd rather have a roof over your head, comfortable beds, and do it all for cheap, check in here.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 28 2008 \\tUmmmm No!\\tThis is basically a transient hotel. Yes, the location is awesome, but if you suffer from allergies, this is not the place for you. There is massive dirt everywhere. Don't even look at the dust monsters under the stairs. The best thing was when we looked at our pictures later and saw all the gross drip marks on the wall that we couldn't see in the dim, dingy lighting. The elevator is cute, but sliding your money to the woman behind the glass is scary. The mold in the bathroom is also scary and very pink. We stripped the bed of the comforter and put several layers of our own blankets down, including two sleeping bags. We felt that was pretty good protection and we didn't get a rash or anything like that. We came prepared for a dump and we weren't disappointed. The room had a wide variety of appliances though, including a toaster oven, microwave, and a mini fridge. Anyway, it's a really cheap place to stay in the heart of boys town and the doors are really thin, but it wasn't too scary in a dangerous sort of way. I'd never do it again, but it was a sort of adventure.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 26 2008\\tFine for the price\\tThis hotel isn't posh or upmarket but when you are only paying $50 a night it really isn't that bad. The room was clean enough although I stayed there for 3 nights and never had a maid come and service the room. The bathroom is old and dated but functional. The location is great for boystown / north halsted bars and very close to the train station. I thought it was fine for the price and would stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",

Heard this place wasn't great but figured it wouldn't be bad for a few hours of sleep.. First off, got there and the lady at the desk was rude and mean, got over that and went upstairs to our room the hallways smelled really bad, got into the room and it was filthy , smelled bad, stains on the carpet and chairs, stains on the bedsheets and pillowcases, hair on the pillows, looked like they made an attempt to make the beds.. but they definately hadn't washed the sheets or pillowcases or anything since the last guests stayed in room, carpet was filthy, furnature had cigarette burns on it, everything was just disgusting.. i didn't even want to touch anything. Ceiling light didn't work, fan looked like it was going to fall off the ceiling, electrical looked dangerous,no screens on the windows, they wouldn't let us have guests in the room.. even for 15 mins while we got ready to go out.. I honestly would expect a homeless shelter to be nicer than this place.. i highly recommend spending the extra money on a real hotel.. even if a person or two has to sleep on the floor.. it would be cleaner than the beds in this place...ewwww\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 17 2007 \\tA dirty scarey place\\tWe stayed for a weekend and unfortunately it was during the Chicago marathon, when it was very hard to find downtown hotels. The outside of the hotel is classic, vintage and in a great neighborhood with great ethnic restaurants and coffeehouses. We're used to &quot;European-type&quot; hotels.But the charm ended there. The hotel and room was dirty, smelly (cat urine and cigarettes), unsafe (the door didn't lock properly), and the phone cord had been ripped out of the wall. The walls are very thin, but luckily the guy in the neigboring room, watched sitcoms late into the night and not porn. Why did I stay there with my 4 kids? I figured that since the hotel had a website, it must be ok. We figured that we'd be &quot;out and about&quot; all day visiting the sites. And now we have great stories about staying in a flop house. But at the time, my children and I were definitely afraid when we stayed there. I'm amazed that this hotel exists, as it is more like the homeless shelter that I volunteer for.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 11 2007 \\tFaye\\tA place right out of a movie: hexagon tile floors, an elevator that holds four with a cage door to close before it works. If you want to visit Chicago, don't mind some rather simple place to stay, and want to be two blocks north of the scoreboard at Wrigley; this is it. I keep expecting Faye Dunaway and Jack friggin Nicholson to come around the corner anytime. A bonus is access to the redline el that takes you downtown to anything else you might want to visit: Lincoln Park Zoo, anything on Michigan, the museums, Soldier field, etc. North (away from the ballpark) you find a latino neighborhood with a mexican grocery store and a wonderful panderia, just right for breakfast goodies. Several taverns in the same location with non-wrigleyville prices. Five stays there, intend a sixth this summer.\\t\\n\",\n",

( the doctor says it's bed bugs) Not to mention I tried to bring a vistor in and I had to pay a $10 cover to get him in! I also had to pay $5 extra for a/c! The hallways smell of urine, booze, and nastines! The manager had no customer service skills what so ever! The water presure was was sub par... I got a better shower waking in rain! The sheets had holes in them... over all i think that there are prisons better then his hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",

Yeah I saw a mouse and the smoke detector was chirping (we took it off the ceiling ourselves), but we just sorta laughed at the experience. One of the employees, Judy, was very nice if you strike up a conversation. She'll give you everything you need if you just simply ask! FYI, our sheets seemed pretty clean. All you need (liquor store/bakery/bar/restaruant/market/train station) is right down the block too!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 20 2004\\tPerfectly acceptable for not much money\\tI've stayed at Sheffield House three times in the last four summers for a few nights at a time. I go to Chicago to hang out with friends, so I'm only in the room long enough to sleep and get cleaned up. I won't contend that the place is the Ritz, but it's a perfectly acceptable place to stay if what you want is a fairly comfortable bed for the night and a shower in the morning. The bedding is a little worn, the towels are a little small, and you won't get chocolates on your pillow. Oh well. It's just a couple of blocks south of the el in a quiet residential neighborhood (though I've never been there when the Cubs are playing). I just hope the place doesn't get so popular that they jack up the rates or I can't get a room when I'm in town.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 12 2004\\tKnow what you're getting into!\\tI wanted to stay close to Wrigley Field for as cheap as possible. This fit my budget! I was there in mid August of 2001 and blew the fuse in my room. Being from the SFO Bay Area, this reminded me of the Tenderloin District. Having said that, during my stay it was quiet, I noticed a family of four staying there as well. Wrigley Field is 2 blocks away, the El is 3 blocks. There is a neighborhood bar (Wrigleyville North) a half a block away. Best but not least, a block beyond that is a retail district with numerous affordable restaurants.If this bothers you, stay downtown.\\t\\n\",\n",

I felt that this was the place where Elwood lived in the Blues Brothers, nice Chicago touch. If you like dust and dirt, this is the best place to stay in Chicago. Staff looked me over like they were going to rob me when I left. The drunks, I mean transients who live here have that natural urine smell that you look for in a nice place to stay. This place is a cheap place to stay, I mean cheap. I used plastic bags to line the bed because my bed sheets were naturally pokka dotted, gross. If you like sleazy dives come stay at the Sheffield House, its one experience you will never forget.\\t\\n',\n",

       " \"May 28 2003\\tYou get what you pay for!\\tOther reviews I have read have been right on! The place is old and dirty and is home to some unique individuals. On the other hand it is a great location for a group trip to Wriggleyville where all you care about is a roof over your head, a bed to sleep in, and a little extra money for the bar tab. The good point is when your stumbling back after a night in Wriggleyville you'll mix right in. The subway system is located blocks away and the place is a good Chicago experience away from the hotel norm. Parking can be tough to find because the hotel is in the heart of a populated multi residential neighborhood.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 31 2003\\tNot the best idea\\tI happen to live on the same block as the Sheffield House. Two positive things about this place: It's cheap ($30) and it is ideally located for the Wrigleyville neighborhood (right on the north end of Wrigleyville.) The bad: This place is sleazy with drunks staggering around and frequent police visits. It used to be called The Carlos Hotel and was targeted at transient (live-in) guests. It did clean up a lot when the name changed, but I'd still avoid it if possible.\\t\\n\",\n",

I haved stayed at Comfort Inns before and they always prove to be clean, and nice and always a good deal for the money however this time I was completely shocked by how nice the lobby, hallways, room and bathroom was. To top off our stay, the complimentary breakfast was extremely tasty and the front desk clerks met every need we had with a smile. I had the pleasure of speaking to the one of the managers over the phone and she likewise did everything possible to make our stay perfect. To finish off, the parking at this hotel is almost half of all other parking in the downtown area and is convient to the hotel. The hotel is a close walk to Michigan Ave. and to lots of great restaurants. So, if you are looking for a great deal is an expensive city, give the Comfort inn hotel and suites a try and ask for a king room at the end of the hallway. That is where we stayed and the room was large and perfect!!!\\t\\n',\n",

Parking was easy - right next door with in/out privileges and unlike the other reviewer there is no trouble returning th carr transponder when you check out. Check-in went smoothly as did check-out. Breakfast was included and that makes it a very good deal. Rooms are small but modern and well equipped. Many of the other guests were European (that's a good thing - giving a cosmopolitan atmosphere) The location is great as you can walk to all the downtown tourist sites. I would go back provided we get the same rate of about $130/night.\\t\\n\",\n",

The hotel is located just 10-15 minutes walking from the loop, and you can walk anywhere in downtown if your up for it. In the area around the hotel there are lots of good restaurants.We booked a queen room, the room is small and crampy. It is sort of long and not very wide, and then cramped with furniture making it kind of an annoyance when you have to move your suitcases all the time to pass through the room. For a longer stay, i think i would go crazy with annoyance. The free breakfast was good and very standard, including a waffle bar which is nice. All in all the hotel offered a great value for money, we payed about half of other hotels in the same area. But it comes for a price, the rooms are small and you do have to walk 10-15 minutes for the attractions.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Sep 11 2009 \\tWould not go back.\\tFirst of all, if all you are looking for is location and a parking/internet bargin, I would suggest this hotel. Otherwise, forget it. I had a single queen room and it was tiny. There was barely any space to sit, except for the bed and at the tiny desk for a computer. The internet access is free-but it's hardwired and very slow. I tested the connection and it's capable of higher speeds, but they limit the speeds to a crawl. Not worth the hassle, even for free. There is not a fridge or microwave. The customer service is horrible. They forgot to clean my room and then admonished me when I asked for towels, tissues, etc when I returned to the hotel at midnight. I wasn't told upon arrival that it's good to unload before parking in the lot, so I assumed that the lot was connected to the hotel. I wound up dragging my luggage around the block, in front of the Pizzaria Uno and into the street (due to construction) in order to get into the hotel. And honestly, out of any dozens of hotels I've ever stayed at, this bed was the most uncomfortable. It was incredibly hard and the pillows were flat. My husband and I left with sore bodies and necks (and exhaustion from being unable to sleep) for two days. I just cannot recommend this hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",

I had room 701 and it was a good location --the window faced ohio street and there was just one room caddy corner to us noise level was very low -- even street noise. The bathoom was spick and span. Shiney tiles lined the shower wall and ceramic tile on the floor. Granite counter top/sink area. Bed was very comfortable and had a thin blanket in betwen the sheets ('cause I kick the comforter off anywhere I go - too risky). The sheets were white and clean. The pillows (5 of them) were downy soft and fluffy! I did not find the room to be too small. The hall did smell of smoke... but I didn't spend much time there and it did not effect the room. I am very antismoke and if the roomed smelled it would have been a BIG problem. It did not.Breakfast was included each morning (until 11am on weekends and 9:30 during the week). Cups, plates, bowls, and utensils were disposable. I would recommend bringing your coffee cup or glass from the room (near the ice bucket) down to breakfast to cut down on waste. Items: Cereal, yogurt, bagels, croissants, muffins, english muffins, danishes, instant hot chocolate/oatmeal, waffle maker, hard boiled eggs, cranberry/apple/orange juices, milk, apples and bananas.Carl the doorman was the go-to man for directions. Checkin and out was easy. They even held our bags so we didn't have to check in early and pay a fee. Equipped us with a map and recommended a few nearby sites and we were free to start our trip without lugging our bags with us. Location was great -- literally just around the corner from the CTA. Gino's East and Portillo's Hotdogs are within a short walk. The Mag mile is also very close and easily accessible by walking.Oh and complimentary internet access. I recommend it and will stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",

There's no wifi, but there is hard-wired internet access. I couldn't get it to work, though. That may have been my issue, but wifi would be nice, to be sure. The hotel didn't charge my credit card until two days after departure and left the hold on the card until I called them about it three days after departure. The breakfast area is somewhat cramped and the choices are limited. Food quality was fair, but acceptable. Better food quality and larger selection for the rate charged would have been appreciated. Overall a decent enough experience. I'm on the fence as to whether or not I would return or recommend the property. I will admit to being partial to boutique hotels.\\t\\n\",\n",

I found the Comfort Inn &amp; Suites Downtown on lastminutetravel.com for $100/night. We couldn't have been happier with this hotel. We lived in Chicago for a few years, 10 years ago, so we know how important public transportation is in town. We were just steps from the red line and the 22 and 36 buses, as well as a 24 hour Jewel/Osco. We were there for 3 nights, ate and drank all over town &amp; didn't step foot in a single taxi. We each spend $12 on a 3 day CTA pass. The hotel was super clean and very quite. It's true there are few rooms with views as it is sandwiched between two larger buildings. Personally, we don't go to chicago for the view. Staff was very friendly, lobby was clean and safe and coffee available 24 hours. We requested feather pillows and 5 were waiting for us upon our arrival. Yes, the rooms are small but provided everything we required.We hit up Chicago every summer and I look forward to staying at the Comfort Inn &amp; Suites again.\\t\\n\",\n",

It is a semi-renovated hotel in the North Bridge area of Chicago. It\\'s best quality is location - very close to the Magnificent Mile, and within walking distance of all the best sites in Chicago. But the downside....Except for the handful of rooms facing the street, the rooms are like COFFINS. The hotel is sandwiched between two other buildings, and so most of the rooms face onto a lightwell. No matter what floor you\\'re on, you feel buried. The room was totally no frills, in the same way that Motel 6 rooms are no frills. The room was clean, in the same way that Motel 6 rooms are (usually) clean. The in-room safe? It didn\\'t work. Overall, less than impressed. If you\\'re visiting Chicago, do yourself a favor and find a hotel that is situated on a corner of a block, so that you can get a room with windows and light and a view.

The breakfast was the only downfall. Plastic cups, plates, knives &amp; forks. We got a bit sick of it along with the poor choice, cereal, bagels or waffles was all on offer. There's free internet in the lobby which is great. We got a great deal for 5 nights so it was excellent value.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 6 2009 \\tWhat an unbelievable find!\\tI was in town for business and researched beyond belief for location and price. First it is very easy to get to Midway via the &quot;EL&quot; train. It took about 40 minutes, saved me money and the hotel is 1 1/2 blocks from the stop. I like to experience all parts of this city and find it a inconsiderate environmental and monetary waste to take a taxi when it's not necessary. Now if you have a family and tons of luggage that is a different story. I digress. I walked into the hotel not know what to expect and its a classic style hotel that is so darn clean I was floored. I had a great room, not small at all. I think people who come from the suburbs do not know what small really is. The room itself was super super clean as well. The location of the hotel is superb, you can walk to so many great restaurants and Magnificent Mile is just, I think, 3 blocks away. If the weather is good I really recommend walking as you miss things if you cab it. Or just take the &quot;EL&quot; train. It's safe. The staff at the hotel was absolutely wonderful. They were a wealth of information and really helped me find whatever I needed. They always had a smile and a great attitude. On one Lucky occassion I had the assistance of the General Manager as she was at the desk assisting her employees. That is just great to see that a top manager at the hotel cares and does not hide from her guests in order to avoid anything. I truly recommend this hotel for anyone who cares about, Cleanliness, Value, Service and Location.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Mar 5 2009 \\tSpent a month here\\tI actually was a long-term guest of this hotel because of a large project at work. I enjoyed the stay for the most part...the staff was friendly and helpful but my big issue is the rooms. I've stayed here on four or five seperate occasions and I've had one decent room. Some of the rooms are tiny! And by tiny I mean 10 feet by 15 feet max. I usually get put on the upper floors (15-17) and I'm not sure if that makes a difference or not but there's hardly room to move around. If you were only staying one night and were a solo traveler, it'd probably be fine. However, I'm usually there for at least three or four days straight. It's is a quiet hotel, which downtown is nice. However, if you open the window, you're immediately reminded that you're in downtown Chicago. That doesn't really bother me (I lived in New York for five years, Chicago for two) but keep in mind there is a fire station a few blocks away...and they're busy. Overall, I'd recommend the hotel but not for a long-term stay. Parking is $25 per night, which is pretty standard downtown, but beware.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Feb 5 2009 \\tExcellent group sales \\tOur group of 20 PAX were accommodated at the Comfort Inn Hotel in Chicago for a week. First of all, the group sales manager Marc Condie was extremely helpful and effective in getting quotation and finalizing the reservation. He proposed upgrade of 4 normal rooms to 4 suits. When the group has arrived to the property, they were settled very fast and efficient. Our stay was great. We would be happy to deal with this Hotel as a corporate client in future.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jan 31 2009 \\tGreat Breakfast and fab location\\tI booked through lastminutetravel.com and this hotel came up as a 'secret location' option (where you're hotel isn't revealed until you are sent booking confirmation). The hotel was in a fantastic location, just around the corner from the subway and there is parking available right next to the hotel ($25 per night). The breakfast offered a lot of choice and in a buffet style whereby I could eat as much as I wanted to fill me up for a whole day exploring the city. The door staff are extremely friendly and helpful in answering questions about the city. I stayed two nights and towels and beds were made each morning after breakfast. The hotel rooms have internet available at no extra cost and although they are quite small there is a lot of storage space and an iron and ironing board in the room. I stayed on the 11th floor and had no problem with city noise and I couldn't hear noise from other rooms. I had a very pleasant stay and would absolutely stay at this hotel again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 31 2009 \\tFlawless Professional Service\\tPlanning a trip for 72 choir members can often be overwhelming, but the hotel management took the worry and hassle out of every aspect of our two night stay. From check in to check out, we were extremely impressed with everything the hotel had to offer. We couldn't have picked a better location- it was an incredible deal. The singers could walk everywhere and truly enjoyed their time in the city. Thank you Comfort Inn, if we are in Chicago again we will be back!\\t\\n\",\n",

It is a great location - near the fancy shopping and transit and buses.The hotel is clean and I found the staff to be friendly.

       " 'Nov 25 2008 \\tGreat location and good value for money\\tI spent 3 days visiting Chicago on a side trip to a business meeting in another state. As I was traveling solo, I was interested in finding safe, well located accommodation within walking distance of the city highlights. Though the room was small (which I expected) it was well laid out with everything that I needed - including a desk, free internet access (cable), a well appointed bathroom, comfortable bed and adjustable heating. The hotel has no restaurant but is close to a supermarket and restaurants. A casual breakfast buffet is included in the rate and all day coffee and tea are available from the same mezzanine area. The staff were friendly throughout my visit and very helpful on my day of departure - arranging for a cab to arrive at exactly the time I needed it. The only suggestion I would make is that the inclusion of a small fridge would have enhanced an enjoyable stay.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Nov 17 2008 \\tPerfect Location Great Hospitality\\tWhen I booked the hotel, I wasn't expecting too much. I figured I'd have to take the subway everywhere to get around town. When I arrived, my expecttions were blown out of the water. This hotel has a supermarket on one corner, the Weber Grill Restaurant on another, ESPN Zone on the next block, Pizzeria Uno on the other corner, a movie theater one block away, and the Rainforest Cafe and Rock n Roll McDonald's one block away. There is also a Subway across the street for a quick bite to eat. Magnificent Mile is about 5 minutes down the street, Navy Pier took me about 25 minutes to walk. The Red LIne Subway that takes you straight down to the Loop is less than a block away. The location is amazing!The Hotel Staff were all very friendly. When my cab pulled up, the bell staff were immediately picking up my suitcase and putting it in the lobby. The front desk staff were very friendly and informative. They even went online to print my boarding pass on the day of my flight! The front desk staff even held my suitcase all day long after I had checked out, with no hassle. The maid staff cleaned the room very well every day. The room itself was very small, but expected for a 1920's hotel. The room, overall, was very modern and everything was very clean and functional. The view from the window was nothing but a brick wall, which was kind of lame, but not a trip killer. As such, the sunlight never came in to the room, so I always had to have a desk light on.This is a great hotel for the location, price, and staff.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nov 3 2008 \\tGreat location not so great service\\tThe hotel is very conveniently located-you can basically walk to the Magnificent mile in 2 minutes. It is also surrounded by great bars and trendy restaurants. The room is half the size of a regular hotel room but I think that was the right size for Chicago downtown and the price. The hotel needs some maintenance, especially the elevator (was kind of dirty look). I was fairly disappointed with the service-I called at 11 am in advance asking them whether I could have a 2 hour late check out (meaning check out at 2 pm paying 20 USD extra) and they said yes. But then every 15 minutes there was some maid coming or a call reminding me that I should check out. In addition, after I finally could not take it and decided to check out at 1 pm and asked whether I could check my bags, they said yes and then asked me to wait and I waited for 10 minutes. I decided to give up and the receptionist saw me leave and turned her eyes away.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Oct 21 2008 \\tGood Location\\tStayed 2 nights here while touring around Illinois. We found the hotel ideal for our needs. The location is a winner. It is so near the magnificant mile so could drop our shopping bags half way through the day. There are nice little restaurants on the same street. There is an ESPN Sports Bar/Games Centre a few doors down. Rooms are dark but clean. Check out was at 12 but they kept our bags safely for the day as we were not leaving town till late in the day. Staff were very nice.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Oct 20 2008 \\tGood hotel great location\\tI enjoyed staying in this hotel. The location could not be beat. Just about everything was walking distance with plenty of restaurants and shopping along the way. Each corner I turned, I saw something else to do or see. I was only there 3 days but it felt like I got good use of my time because of where the hotel was located. However, if you are traveling to Chicago for a little R&amp;R, this hotel may not be for you. It is located on a busy street and you defintely hear the sounds of the city, not to mention your neighbors. Also, the room is a bit small so a traveling couple or family may feel a little cramped and I did hear someone complain about a lack of cell phone service in their room. But if the room is just for sleeping, showering, and changing, then it is perfect. Oh and the continental breakfast was decent, you could even make your own waffles. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when I go back to Chicago.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 11 2008 \\tYou can access to many shopping pionts by walk.\\tMy room charge was US$230 before tax per night. This is my record of the most expensive night in Comfort group ever stayed ($_$)...As somebody mentinoed below, the room is small, but you may find bigger room with just additional small expense. I feel this point when checking floor plan , not confirmed yet. Even it is small room, it is still better than tourists hotel in Hong Kong.I drove to Chicago , and it is very convenient of car park key which hotel provided me with US$25/night.Michigan avenue is famouse shopping , business street as you know. We can walk and enjoy this street. You may not need car while you're around city center for your visiting.Fleming's steak house is just second next buidling from this hotel. We took dinner here to celebrate our marriage day with good cooking beef and good taste of wine. Ah, Chicago!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jun 25 2008 \\tPleasantly surprised\\tI was expecting a typical downtown Chicago experience for $188 a night but what I got was so much more. The hotel is ideally located near all the theater, shopping and restaurants Chicago has to offer. The staff is helpful, the complimentary breakfast is more than adequate including make-your-own waffles and the sheets, pillows and towels and all high quality and comfy. Ask for room 1209 if you want tons of room and complete silence and privacy.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jun 23 2008 \\tVery poor Chicago hotel\\tI advise buyer beware when considering this hotel. The rooms are very small, poorly furnished, and withoutadequate lighting. Most rooms have no natural light.Security is not adequate and do not meet minimal standards. I love Chicago, and have stayed at much nicer 3 starhotels for the same price. Chatting with others in the elevator only confirmed this is a general impression. I spent very little time in the hotel, and will never stay there again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 18 2008 \\tComfort Inn \\tJust got back from Chicago and our stay at the Comfort Inn. It was very clean and the staff was very friendly. We did think the room could have had better lighting. We didn't have any view at all, one window faced the parking garage and the other was the inside wall of the hotel. This didn't matter because we weren't there to look out the windows!! As mentioned, the parking garage is right next door. It was $25 a day and you could come and go as needed. We loved the location! It was close to the red line and Michigan ave. and several bus stops. Also, there were several great places to eat close by-Weber Grill, P.F. Changs,ESPN, California Pizza Kitchen, and Pizza places. I did read a review that mentioned not enough seating in the breakfast area. I will agree with that. Most of the time it was pretty full, but they opened up a conference room and we sat in there. We will definitely stay here again!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 20 2008 \\tGreat hotel - great location\\tMy husband and I had a week in Chicago at the end of April. We stayed at the Comfort Inn. From the very start, the service we received from all the staff was very good. The reception staff were very helpful and professional. About half an hour after we got to the room, reception rang to check everything was OK (which it was).We had requested a quiet room and this was sorted out for us. It had a dual aspect (although there was only a car park and the inner part of the hotel to look at), so this meant it was quite dark. However, the room was very large and comfortable.The breakfast was of a good standard. However, within the breakfast room, there really needed to be more tables and chairs, rather than sofas. There is a conference room next to the breakfast room, which you can use if there isn't a conference taking place. When we used the conference room, we got to talk to other guests.Chicago is a lovely town - very walkable. The Chicagoans were very friendly. I can recommend a baseball game at either the White Sox or the Cubs. The weather was quite variable - one day it was 80F/26C, the next 55F/12C.I can also recommend the Historic Skyscraper Architectural Walking Tour and dinner on the 96th floor of the John Hancock Centre.I will definitely return to Chicago and will stay at the Comfort Inn again.\\t\\n\",\n",

Great for walking to many locations. Several restaraunts very, very close. Michigan Ave, only 2 or 3 blocks. The only problem with this hotel, if you don't get a suite, the rooms are TINY. But they are the cleanest rooms this side of Las Vegas.I would definately stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 15 2008\\tGreat Little Hotel in Big City\\tI stayed at this hotel for 2 nights this past weekend. It is really a nice hotel - some old world charm (building is from the 1920's), but recently refurbished. Doesn't feel like a chain at all. Decor and fixtures are all modern and in excellent condition. We had a suite (my sister, 14 year old nephew and myself), and it came with microwave, refrigerator, sink in the living room. Bathroom, shower, beds - all great.Front desk personnel couldn't be nicer and more helpful - they really seemed to take pride in their customer service. They helped with bus routes, restaurants, etc.Continental breakfast very nice - hard boiled eggs, waffles, yogurt, juice, bakery. My only complaint (and this is getting picky) is that there wasn't enough seating in the breakfast area - too many sofas and coffee tables that should be replaced with tables.Last but not least - excellent location. Walking distance either way up Michigan Ave to Water Tower, John Hancock or other direction to Millenium Park and Art Museum. Convenient to buses on both State Street or Michigan Ave. Next door to ESPN Zone (great for kids).Chicago Tip: Get a visitor bus pass. They have them in train station and I believe John Hancock center too. $5 for one day, $9 for 2. Chicago buses are very convenient and easy to use.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 3 2008 \\tGreat Location Great Price Great Breakfast\\tI booked this hotel for a vacation in Chicago, mostly to shop and eat on the Magnificent Mile. It was great; and it was only two blocks from Magnificent Mile. Somehow we ended up with a suite without asking for it or paying anything extra (probably because we got in so late). Parking was cheap ($25 compared to $46 at other hotels on the Mile), maybe because there was no direct parking garage access to the hotel and you had to walk out of the garage to get to the hotel. The breakfast was great and had everything you could think of. The rooms were very clean and mostly everything looked newish. The only reason I didn't give this place a five was that the comforters have not been updated to the duvet style like most other hotels. Also, because I was a Choice Privileges member (maybe Gold) I got check-out extended until 2:00.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 22 2008\\tVery unhelpful\\tI stayed there for a couple of years for a June trade show because of the price.The attitude of the front desk and the staff is poor.This is a hotel which is supposed to cater to business travelers, yet they don't serve breakfast untill 7:00 AM on week daysThe year before I mentioned this to the front desk and they said they would look into it.But I was infomed hautingly that I was making an unreasonable request the next year. Normally the set up has some things out at 6:30 and I tried to grab something. You would have thought I was commiting a crime by their reaction.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Feb 25 2008 \\tSuite LIfe\\tI must say I was very impressed with the decor and the rooms. Definately not your normal comfort Inn &amp; Suites that you see off to the road on the interstate. The bathrooms are very clean and has an elegant feeling to the design. The view of the North End of the chicago skyline is wonderful and everything is in walking distance as far as resturants and bars.

We had a nice standard room with a large bathroom. We paid 189 USD/night , which I thought was a great deal for this hotel.A complimentary breakfast buffet is served every morning. We loved it! When you stay here you will be in a fantastic location in downtown Chicago North side. Close to michgan ave and really close to clark street were a lot of nice blues clubs are situated.Right across from our hotel at State street you will find a place called Pops For Champagne. It was a really nice cozy place with Champagne bar and live jazz. Do check it out!! We love Chicago and will return again and again.. We will choose this hotel for our next visit.\\t\\n',\n",

Directly across the street is a Starbucks, PF Changs, and a mall to name a few. The room was extremely small, but if you are not planning on being in the room a lot, then it doesn't matter. Also, there was a continental breakfast, which hardly any other hotel had. The pice was about $120 a night plus $20 a day for parking... very reasonable. I'd stay again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dec 20 2007 \\tFantastic Location; Great Breakfast\\tI was in town for a conference and chose this hotel primarily because of easy access to the metro. It did not disappoint me at all and I am very pleased that my experience with the hotel is in line with all the good stuff I read about it from the web. First, the breakfast offered had a reasonable variety of breads, cereals and juices. LIke other reviewers, I too was bowled over by the hot waffles. The fact that all this was free really wowed me. Second, the hotel staff was SO helpful and polite when giving directions and assisting with requests. The metro was just 1.5 blocks away but I was hopeless with directions and one of the staff was kind enough to walk me there himself. In addition, they put me in a smoking floor the first night and I asked for a change of rooms. They gave me one the next day and helped me to move everything over. Later, I realized that I left my travel adaptor in the first room and they helped me to bring it back. I give a thumbs up to the service level in this hotel. Third, the location was just fantastic. I could get to everywhere very quickly either by metro or on foot. There was food nearby and a supermarket to meet my grocery needs. Finally, the condition of the rooms was good, everything was clean and the air smelt ok. All in all, I would definitely stay here again when I come to Chicago.\\t\\n',\n",

       " \"Oct 10 2007 \\tDoes exactly what it says on the tin!\\tWe have just returned from the 2007 Chicago Marathon and stayed at the Comfort Inn in Downtown Chicago. The hotel is really well situated for Michigan Ave, where all the &quot;nice&quot; shops are and (crucially) if you are coming from O'Hare airport, as we were, it has a train station situated right around the corner. For $2 you can travel 18 miles into the city centre! What more do you want? Even more satisfying is the fact that the track runs parallel for a good few miles with the Kennedy Expressway, which seems almost permanently gridlocked, so you can congratulate yourself on saving time AND money getting the train!We found the hotel more than met our needs and expectations. I simply cannot understand why people are griping about it. Our room number was 1204 and I will admit it was a little dark, as it faced an inner courtyard with little natural light, but being on the 12th floor and not facing the main street has distinct advantages when it comes to blocking out traffic noise, so we were more than happy. We had a very comfy bed, with loads of pillows, great air-conditioning and a really cool bathroom, with a heated light on a timer. The shower worked really well, we had complimentary newspapers and the coffee making facilities were easy to use (although biscuits might have been nice)! The biggest benefit to us as a couple was free wi-fi, which enabled us to hold video conversations with our kids in England over the webcam. Saved a fortune in mobile phone charges!Breakfast was great. Lots of choice and plenty of it. The only downside for me was that the breakfast area was extremely small and you struggled to get a table, as the hotel was full of marathon runners all wanting to eat at the same time! The staff had no problem with you removing food to your room if you chose to do so. They even arranged for the hours to be altered on marathon day to cater for those who had to eat by 6am. I hope the staff got a bonus for being up so early! The staff were friendly and professional. No complaints whatsoever about them. I do wonder if people choosing this hotel and rating it unfavourably are expecting the Cannes Carlton. This is not a particularly &quot;high end&quot; hotel, but it is worth the money and does exactly what it says it will. You will have a comfortable night in the Comfort Inn! Whilst the Chicago Hilton might be grander (and it was, because we attended a party there) the food was cold, poor value for money and the staff much less friendly. Give me the Comfort Inn anyday!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Oct 3 2007 \\tVery basic and not what I expected\\tThis hotel is well situted for downtown Chicago, but is really very basic, and not what I expected. The rooms (allocated to me and my group) were very small, dark, with little daylight, backing on to a multistory car park. There were no hotel facilities at all! Only vending machines. No bar, cafeteria, restaurante, business center, nothing. A disappointing continential breakfast was served on the first floor in a small area with only 7 or 8 tables, and a funny kind of sofa arrangement. There was not enough space for all the guests wanting to take breakfast to sit down, and many had to stand up. The plates, glasses and cutlery were all plastic.The second day we all went out for breakfast. I guess this place would be okay for low budget travellers with low expectations, but it is by no means a mid-class establishment.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 2 2007 \\tHorrible !! Why Do People Rate This So High - Certainly Don't Deserve 3 Diamond\\tI honestly don't &quot;get it.&quot; Why people give this hotel such a high rating, and why it has earned a 3-Diamond Rating? First of all, I am a Choice Hotels Rewards Member, so when I stayed, I had to use 20,000 points to stay here (normal Choice Hotels take 8,000 points). Everything about this hotel was bad, starting with parking... First of all, the way this hotel is set up, you have to park on the street with your &quot;flasher on&quot; and check-in and unload all your belongings. WHen I arrived, the 3 spaces (the only available unloading spaces) in front of the hotel were full. Then, after paying my 20,000 points (or your $300+ room fee) for your room, on top of that you have to pay an additional $25 per day for a parking permit. Keep in mind, that this allows you access to a nearby parking ramp, but this ramp is not even attached to the hotle, furthermore, the stairs and elevator exit to the ramp are no where close to the entrance to the hotel. Alright, so now that you understand how much of a hassle just simply parking / and checking-in are... I have to tell you about the elevators. The elevators smelled like vomit. Really bad vomit. The had sign in them saying &quot;Please pardon the smell, we are working on the grease dump...&quot; (whatever that means?) ANyways, here's another wierd thing, I was assigned to room 1408 - which in itself was kind of freaky, cause I had just seen that movie prior to my visit to chicago. When I got to my room, the first thing I noticed was a horrible view. I had a view of an old, dirty brick wall, that went straight down to a garbage pit. No city views, just this ugly wall, and a parking ramp. The internet connection did not work in my room. Two people stayed during this visit, and they were so &quot;cheap&quot; with the soap - so I went to the front desk to ask for more, and they acted like I was asking for thier first born son, they did not provide me with adequate amounts of soap / shampoo, even when I went to the desk. Even though my room was completey taken care of by my &quot;points&quot; they still placed (4) seperate &quot;holds&quot; against my credit card in these ammounts: $75, $75, $58, and $53. I went to the front desk to ask them why, and all they told me was tha it was to insure my card was valid, and that the hold would be romoved 5 days after check out. In reality, the only holds that should have been on there were 2 holds, each for $25 for parking (2 days). The room itself ( #1408) was old, and smelled like smoke, even though I was in a non-smoking room. The wall A/C - heater ran constantly, no mater what setting you put it on, it always ran, making that annoying &quot;fan&quot; noise. This place is horrible, no matter what you read. ANd it is very, very expensive for what you get. DOn't get me wrong, I absolutely love CHoice Hotels, and Comfort Inns, just NOT THIS ONE. If you are in Chicago, and you want to stay at a Very, very nice Comfort Inn - to me the best Comfort Inn, I have ever stayed at in my life, then you need to check out the Comfort Inn in MUNDELEIN, IL - you will not be sorry. As far as this Comfort Inn and SUites in Downtown Chicago - Please trust me, and stay elsewhere for your $300.00 - you may just regret your stay here.\\t\\n\",\n",

We loved this set up, and it added a level of luxury we weren't expecting. But be forewarned: if you're not in a suite, the rooms can be quite small--still with some premium fixings--but small, and many of the rooms face an inner courtyard with only a large shaft of light. Considering the noise of the city, this might be an advantage. And given all there is to do in Chicago, you might not need a lot of space. But to guarantee the space you need, look into the possibility of a suite. Service was accommodating and polite; housekeeping was wonderfully quiet and respectful. There is no bar or restaurant in the hotel (Japanese place next door is good), so there's no scene. There's a Whole Foods Market on Huron, three blocks away, which is great for stocking that mini-fridge with healthy snacks. A solid, comfortable establishment in the midst of a classy urban environment.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 24 2007\\tVery pleased with Comfort Inn \\tRecently stayed at the Comfort Inn &amp; Suites in the North River Chicago area on E. Ohio. The room was very clean, great towels and bedding and location was close enough to attractions (Navy Pier)) and transportation systems. Self-parking was available with in/out priviledges (which is a premium in downtown Chicago) and not too steep, and the in-house continental breakfast was good. Would definitely stay there again as it was very reasonable and suited our needs -- just don't bring a car if you can help it. Very easy to get around and save parking fees and aggravation.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 8 2007 \\tGreat Miracle Mile locartion\\tThis hotel has a great location with very competitive pricing. The room was quite spacious and in great condition. Parking was $25 per day with in and out privileges. The garage is next door, but has no direct connection to the hotel. (But do you really need a car in downtown Chicago.)\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 7 2007\\tGreat Stay!\\tMy husband and I recently spent 3 nights at the Comfort Inn and Suites in downtown Chicago and were very pleased with the experience. I booked it thru the website of the airline I used and got a great deal. Our room was on the 7th floor and faced the street, but was very quiet. We had a nice view of the city. The room was a little small, but very clean and the bathroom was especially nice. For a lower cost hotel, I thought the free breakfast buffet was wonderful - so much to choose from including hot waffles! We parked in the lot adjacent to the hotel ($25.00/night) but never needed to take the car out - we were convenient to everything. Navy Pier was an easy walk. Two years ago, we stayed at the Best Western River North, Chicago, and had planned to stay there again. Their prices had gone up, so I decided to try something else and I am glad I did. River North was fine and had free parking, but overall, I like the Comfort Inn better. The lobby was much nicer and they had someone there to help us book a city tour. If you prefer to spend more of your money on restaurants and attractions, but still want a comfortable night's sleep, I definitely recommend this hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 2 2007\\tClean and new with a few problems\\tI was in town for a large conference at McCormick and made a reservation at the Comfort Inn at the last minute because of its low price and good reviews. The Good: As many of the other reviews point out, this hotel is clean and quiet. It appears as though everything was recently remodeled. The bathrooms have nice working features and clean floors. The room had nice new carpet and furnishings. With the exception of the neighboring ice machine closet, the hotel was very quiet. The hotel also has a good location. Plenty of restaurants around and transportation options. The Bad: I stayed 5 nights and the free in-room internet service was down for three of those nights. The front desk said it took three days just to come and look at the problem. The internet went out on Saturday, so I can understand that weekend technicians may be hard to come by, but I would expect a major hotel chain like Comfort Inn to have contracts with services available on the weekend. Other problems include the room phones and TV. The room had two phones, but the handset on the bedside phone did not work. The TV had many channels, but they were hard to enjoy due to poor reception and signal noise. My room had a view of a brick wall 10 feet away. And finally, the staff was questionable. Checkin went well, but checkout was poor. The desk attendant was clearly more interested in other things. No questions about my stay and very short with answers on how to get to the airport. Left a bad taste in my mouth as I left the hotel.I would recommend staying here in the near future, but fear that the quality will decrease with age. I doubt I will return.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 29 2007 \\tGood stay for visit to Chicago\\tWe stayed here for a 5 day 4 night trip to Chicago and if we come back to the city, we'll definitely stay here again. This hotel is within walking distance to many main attractions---the magnificent mile, Navy Pier, many very good restaurants (Pizzeria Uno is basically next door), etc. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was small, as described in other reviews, however we used it just to sleep and shower so it was perfect for us. If you want a place with a balcony and lots of sitting area, this is not the hotel for you. The beds were not bad----nothing exceptional like pillow tops or anything, but were good enough for a restful nights sleep. I was particularly happy about the hot water for the shower---plenty of it and definitely hot. They offer a continental breakfast which was more than adequate----especially if you plan on eating all the other foods Chicago has to offer throughout the day. There are bagels, cereal, fruit (a little lacking there), Belgian waffles, pastries and hard boiled eggs. Only downfall is breakfast is over at 9am during the week. Weekends is at 11am. Check in was at 3pm and very easy. Check out is at noon, but for $5 we could stay til 2pm. Our only complaint overall was the Internet service. There was supposed to be service in our room, however there wasn't. I'm assuming it was just a freak thing----just bad timing for us that the rooms were unable to get access. Service was available if you took your laptop to the 2nd floor (lounge area) or 1st floor (lobby). It was a slight inconvenience for us---however we were only using the Internet to search for a few local things and our email. We weren't here on business so it wasn't imperative for us to have access. If you definitely need service in your room for work or whatever, you may want to confirm there really is access always and make sure the outage wasn't just during the days we were here. On a side note, good places to eat: Giordanos for deep dish pizza, Pizano's (Italian---portions are huge--alfredo really good), Quartinos, Jakes (bar nearby---good bar food), Ditka's restaurant next to the Tremont Hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 26 2007 \\tGreat Place\\tHotel was great, walked all over Chicago from our hotel. Very close to &quot;el&quot;, restaurants and Michigan Ave. Walking distance to downtown business area and Navy Pier. Very clean. Room was a little small but more than adequate for a couple (you don't go to Chicago to stay in the room). Breakfast was adequate. We had a good view (Rm 801) but could see how the other side of hotel might not have such a great view (lots of buildings in way). Would stay again--got a good price for Chicago. Tip: Eat on the 96th floor of the Handcock Bldg.--make reservations for dinner or lunch (if you want a seat by window). Great view, relaxing, don't have to pay to go up to the observatory and can spend as much time as you want enjoying view and food.\\t\\n\",\n",

Staff was very unfriendly when checking in - did not even tell us our room number or point us in the direction of the elevators when handing us our room keys. Third floor is a designated smoking floor - the entire floor smells as soon as you get off the elevator - if you do not smoke, beware, it is very unpleasant if this is the only floor available.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 2 2007 \\tGreat hotel!\\tMy boyfriend and I stayed at the Comfort Inn &amp; Suites for two nights on June 29 - 30, 2007. The location of this hotel is excellent and we were thrilled to be able to walk everywhere over the weekend. If you are going to be there within the next 8 days (week of July 4, 2007), be sure to check out the Taste of Chicago! (www.tasteofchicago.us) It was great fun! The lake and Michigan Avenue are only a few blocks to the right when you exit the hotel. The hotel itself is very nice. Our room was very small, but we didn't mind since we didn't spend a lot of time in it. The bathroom was very clean, as was the entire room. We had only one small window, which looked onto a nearby wall, but again, we just wanted a place to sleep. The breakfast buffet was fantastic for me because there was a waffle maker! My boyfriend was a little disappointed. They offered coffee, juices, several cereals, hard-boiled eggs, pastries, and bagels. And the waffle maker of course, yum! The eating area is a little awkward since it was pretty busy both mornings and set up like a living room with a few tables nearby, but overall not bad. Just a tip, there are only two small elevators and they're pretty slow. If you are checking out near checkout time, are on a lower floor, and have lots of luggage, it might take a while to get an elevator that can fit you in. I saw several people waiting and not able to get in because of this. We flew into O'Hare (on the top 5 list of worst airports nationwide - lots of delays) and took the train/blue line to the Clark stop. It's very easy and only costs $2 per person. If you don't want to walk to the hotel from there, the cab ride is only about $5-10.I hope that helps! I highly recommend this hotel!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jun 24 2007 \\tExcellent Stay\\tThe staff at this hotel seemed to go out of their way to be courteous and helpful. The location is excellent, and our room was large, clean, and comfortable. We were really impressed and would definitely stay here again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 21 2007 \\tGreat Hotel\\tWe stayed here three nights with Choice Privilege Points which saved us close to $1100. The location is great, just a short walk to the bus stop on Michigan Avenue or the train on State Street. The folks at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. Continental breakfast was slightly above average. Hot Tub came in handy after walking museums all day.Room was very quiet with a fridge and microwave. Others have said the rooms are small, but ours was quite large. Plenty of room for two parents, two teenagers and an air mattress for one of the kids to sleep on.The only thing we didn't like was the double beds, but we couldn't find a hotel in the city with queen beds anyway. Would definitely stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 16 2007 \\tfantastic location!\\tOur trip was a &quot;family&quot; trip, but all adults. Myself (34) and my parents (66 and 67). We had never done Chicago before, so we just picked a random hotel with a good reputation and went with it! What a lucky random pick! The hotel is about 2 blocks from all the magnificent shopping on the Magnificent Mile, has a ton of restaurants within walking distance, and has the nicest staff I've ever had the fortune to meet! We arrived at O'Hare and took a cab to the property, which ran about $42. They offer shuttle service through continental, but it was only going to save us about $6, so we just did the cab thing. When we arrived I was very ill (motion sickness from a cab ride, a total first for me), and as soon as my dad mentioned it, the bellman actually offered to run to the pharmacy for me if I needed it, and the front desk clerk offered to get me a Sprite from the machine downstairs! All the staff were like that, super friendly and willing to go to any lengths to keep you happy!The rooms are sort of suites. They have a single bathroom in the middle, and to the left is the bedroom (2 double beds, a dresser and a TV) and to the right is a small sitting area with a wet bar, closet, TV, desk and sleeper sofa. My parents took the beds, and I slept on the sleeper sofa. Quite comfy, surprisingly! I closed the bed up every morning, and when I came back at night, the maid had pulled the bed out, changed and remade the bed. That takes some dedication! The room was always spotless when we returned.The continental breakfast is offered daily 'til 10 thru the week and 'til 11 on weekends. Had your standard pastries, muffins, fruit, yogurt, etc. Also had a &quot;make your own&quot; belgian waffle station and a chaffing dish full of boiled eggs. Several kinds of fruit juice, milk, water, hot tea, coffee. Small sitting area, but we were always able to have a table.Within walking distance are: Big Bowl (Thai, great homemade ginger ale), California Kitchens Pizza, Weber Grill restaurant, PF Chang.There is a grocery store just around the corner (Jewel Osco), Bloomingdales Home and Design within Reach are across the street. The Grand Train Station is just behind the hotel. The #65 bus comes to that station as well.The hotel is a restored 1920's building and the lobby and mezzanine are beautiful. All in all, the PERFECT place to stay in downtown.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"May 9 2007 \\tGreat Value for the Price\\tMy wife and I stayed at the Comfort Inn for a few days in April 2007 and were very impressed with it. While it can't be understated how small our room was--I'd estimate it came in under 250 square feet--it was well appointed, comfortable and very clean. The staff was friendly, and the continental breakfast was excellent.The location was what really made the deal for us. The Comfort Inn is only a couple of blocks from the Mile, and the nearest Red Line stop is just around the corner. The price was very good as well: Our two-night weekend stay came in under $300, including parking.A tip about requesting rooms: There are only four street-facing rooms on each floor, so if you want any kind of a view, you may want to ask ahead. Two of those street-facing rooms (including the one we stayed in) are incredibly tiny. If you want space, you may have to sacrifice your view. (See the floor map photo I uploaded to get an idea as to the different room sizes.)We'd recommend the Comfort Inn, and would definitely stay there again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 6 2007 \\tDecent mid-priced hotel\\tThis is a good hotel if you decide you want a good location within walking distance to the magnificent mile and VERY close to the red line subway. The rooms are tiny...I mean REALLY tiny. Everything was very clean, though, and the staff was EXCELLENT, very friendly and concerned with making it a great stay. Appears to be recently renovated. Good workout facilities and large whirlpool in the basement. The free breakfast was a nice added touch too. Parking is somewhat of a pain (no valet and you have to walk around the block each time you want to enter the hotel), but you get unlimited in/out privelages. Overall I would recommend it.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Apr 26 2007 \\tNice stay for the money\\tI was pleasantly surprised with my stay at the Comfort Inn &amp; Suites. I was only there one night, but the front desk was SO friendly and helpful. They quickly checked me in and answered any questions I had. The room was very clean, though it was a little small. I was placed in a handicap accessible room so I was surprised there wasn't more room around the sides of the bed. The bathroom was very spacious, my only complaint was there was no medicine cabinet or place to put my toiletries. The sink had a big soap dish on one side of the faucet so very little room for even my toothpaste, let alone my other stuff on the other side.The room was extremely quiet and dark at night. The window didn't have a view (just 3 other walls of what appeared to be the rest of the building). The A/C unit was a little loud when it kicked on in the middle of the night. It woke me up scared half to death when it sounded like a jet taking off in my room. I got used to it, but it wasn't the best.I had trouble connecting to the internet (I got the required CAT-5 cable from the front desk) but I don't know if it was because I was using a Mac or what. I didn't feel like dealing with it because it was late and I was checking out in the morning, but I'm sure if I called the front desk, they would have helped me out. The continental breakfast in the morning was fantastic. Lots of options to choose from, cereal, bagels, pastries, fresh fruit, yogurt my personal favorite, belgian waffles, and more. Perfect way to start the morning.I wish I could have stayed longer to get more of my stay but I was only in town one day for business. The location of this hotel was really ideal. They are right next door to several great restaurants including Pizzeria Uno (the original, I think) and Pizzeria Due (the second one) as well as Weber Grill and ESPN Zone. It was really easy to get to from the airport in a cab (about $34, before tip, with no traffic).All in all, I thought it was a great hotel for a great price right in downtown Chicago. I would definitely stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",

Parking is convenient in the garage directly behind hotel and It's $25 which isn't too bad by Chicago standards. The breakfast bar is decent - standard continental with a waffle maker, cereal, breads, rolls, etc... The view from our room was terrible - looking into a small, closed in courtyard of nastyness. If you need a view, request a room looking outside! The only other complain I had was the coffe at the brekfast area. It was literally undrinkable swill. Really, really bad.

Sleeping rooms were very comfortable, surprisingly spacious and appointed with high-end finishes.

The bed was extremely comfortable and the decor was nice and not the least bit run down. The bathroom was decent size with great water pressure. This is a well taken care of hotel. They serve a good complimentary continental breakfast each morning consisting of cold cereals, bagels/english muffins, and assortment of sweetrolls and muffins, criossants, fruits, hard boiled eggs, instant oatmeals, a variety of juices, and yogurt. It was served on the 2nd floor in a opened foyer area. During the work week, a USA Today paper was delivered to the room every morning.Choice Hotels offers a guaranteed lowest rate through their website or else they willl match, plus 10% off a lower priced website. I found the same $200 room for a $121 at Last Minute Travel,. I put in my claim, and got the room for $108 a night. The only glitch was that the hotel itself did not know it when I checked in but I had my paperwork with me, they accepted it and we spent a great 5 nights with them at half the cost. WARNING: If you find a lower rate, you have to compare it to their standard rates--you can't put in for any discounts, like AAA.  I would definitely stay here again.

Cons - 1: The towels in my room were just plain horrible, comparing them to sandpaper would be an understatement. If I ever stay here again, I'll bring my own. 2: Can't think of anything else! Pros - 1: Location - Red Line only one block away and the hotel sits right in the midst of everything Chicago is all about. 2: The staff was very pleasant. Easy/Quick check in. 3: The room was fantastic. (room 1103). Not sure if I somehow got upgraded, but I was expecting a small room with a queen bed.

Most give you NOTHING. It was fine, with a good assortment of bagels, juices, etc etc. Yes it is a small area. So? We had NO view, unless you like a builing and alley. However the location is very convenient to THE mile, Hard Rock, ESPN, the Red line etc. We got a fairly decent rate (in comparison) on a site recommended to us, which was similar to price line. Bout $120 total I think. On a Sat. night too. I would recommend the place. Good luck.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 7 2006\\tPleasant Stay With Minor Problems\\tThis hotel deserves to be in the Top 20 for all hotels in Chicago. It is comfortable, with appropriate amenities (whirlpool, dry sauna, small workout room, free breakfast). I stay here about 5 times a year when visiting Chicago. The staff are helpful and friendly but not overly solicitious (which is good in my book), the hotel is nicely decorated in the deco style and the rooms are smallish but easy to maneuver around - bathrooms are perfectly adequate with stocked amenities. I have noticed more and more families are staying here, and the breakfast room is a freak show of children at certain hours of the morning with Cheerios and Bananas all over the place, but on the whole it is a pleasant stay and very nicely situated downtown. This used to be a nice hotel for business and European travelers, but word has gotten out, prices have gone up, and you see many more &quot;t-shirt and white socks&quot; tourists with small children. Be forewarned if you mean to check in at 3 pm as it is crawling with tourists needing lots of advice from staff about where to go, what to do, where is the bus, where is the Red Line El (hint: around the corner at State St. to your left past Weber Grill). But hey, its a Comfort Inn, so it is what it is. Still, a good place to stay. Rooms are quiet. Beds could have a better thread count for the sheets considering the price of the room (which are crawling higher even during the slow seasons). My only real complaint is that the front desk staff (during my stay at least) are clueless to their internet service. Above the 3rd floor, the hotel is not wireless, which I would HIGHLY recommend to this hotel. I plugged in my computer and know how to handle settings (disable wireless, use LAN connections, etc.) and the hotel staff kept telling me it was my computer when I knew the problem was their connection (or lack thereof).When I called tech support, they told me the hotel indeed needed to reset their internet server, which no one knew how to do at the hotel, so the &quot;free internet&quot; didn't count this last trip. I moved over to the Palmer House for another stay later that week and plugged right in (they are also not wireless and charge 9.95 per 24 hours) and was immediately on the net. But then that is comparing apples to oranges - the Palmer House has its own I.T. staff. So for what its worth, a good hotel which is changing over to a more touristy spot.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 8 2006\\tFabulous!\\tWent for a &quot;girls' weekend&quot;; 7 of us stayed at the Comfort Inn. We had 3 rooms with 2 double beds, and one room with 1 queen bed. It was WONDERFUL. Everything was new, clean, contemporary. Our room had a fridge, coffee maker, microwave, wet bar, safe, hairdryer, two phones, CD player, and plenty of fluffy towels. Beds were comfy. Climate control worked great, and shower spray was nice and strong. Staff was excellent! Great customer service from everyone we encountered. Excellent continental breakfast (expanded) and coffee and tea available 24 hours a day. PERFECT location. Some of the complaints I read on Tripadvisor about rooms being too small ... our rooms with 2 double beds were quite large. The room with 1 queen bed was certainly smaller ... but I think you get what you pay for. There was some noise because our room was close to a parking structure (car alarms, etc.), but you gotta expect that when you're staying in a big city. Bring your foam earplugs and you'll sleep comfy and cozy like a baby. I travel extensively and this was an above-average hotel stay!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 21 2006 \\tTiny and noisy\\tFirst the pros: in the city center with many dinner options around (Rush str., Weber's Grill, Starbucks just around the corner), the breakfast buffet was monotonous but ok. Several breads, donuts, coffee, milk, juices but everything on plastic plates. Very clean.Cons: tiny! And I say that being European. The rooms in this hotel are little cages. Suffocating atmosphere reinforced by the view from our window (see pix). The room hardly fitted me and my suitcase. Noisy! Terribly! The door of our room did not close well-and I mean the door giving to the corridor so we had to wake up the entire night (every night!) from the voices of other people coming in their rooms. Very unpleasant. The Internet did NOT work and noone cared. Basically the front desk staff couldn't care less about the guests. Unfriendliness behaviour which shocked me given how wonderful Chicagoeans are. So if you travel for business, you'd better forget about this hotel or be prepared to have a not working Internet and noone willing to fix the problem. Not sure if I will stay there again unless I cant find anything more decent at a similar prce in the city.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 14 2006\\tAlmost Perfect Hotel\\tFabulous hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Chicago - fantastic city - and the hotel contributed to our experience. Great room, good bed, perfect night's sleep (couldn't hear any noise, but then again, we were so tired from a full day's entertainment in the city), great service. Only caveat is the parking. They need to tell ALL guests that if they're driving, make sure to park in the loading zone in front of the hotel, pick up a transponder and park in the Nordstrom parking garage (connected to the hotel). Guests then need to exit the garage BEFORE checking out, park in the same loading zone in front, drop off transponder at the same time as check-out. This wasn't made clear when booking and would have saved some confusion. That said, it's a v. minor issue. I read the reviews here and figured it would be a little confusing, but wasn't sure how. Even if you drive to the garage without the transponder, you can still pick it up at the hotel at check in and just show it to the attendant on the way out, before checking out. Apart from this, fantastic stay. Would definitely come here again AND recommend to everyone I know, esp. considering extortionate prices of other Chicago hotels.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 24 2006\\tNice place\\tI stayed here with my husband for the new year. Arrived on the 26.12.05 and stayed for 6 days. We booked a double room. We had 2 double beds, microwave, sink, tea and coffee making facilities in room which was great and a large bathroom. We made use of the in-room(payable)movies most nights. The hotel is in a good location - walking distance to all areas. We walked from the hotel to the aquarium but it is easier and quicker to take the metro. Walking took about 45 minutes but the metro took 15 mins. Metro is located just around the corner from this hotel. Breakfast is continental - bread, cereal, scones etc..but you can go down and grap what you want and bring it back to your room as the eating area is not very big - only about 5 table and chairs. There is a great food shop across the road, so you can pick up anything you need there, they have a great selection of sushi. On the other side of the road is the Red Lobester Restaurant and a great littel blues club - can't remember the name but it is tiny and they play good music. This hotel is by no means the fanciest hotel I have stayed in but it has everything you will need from a hotel and it is great value for the price!!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 30 2005\\tClean hotel. Very helpful staff\\tI booked our room at the comfort Inn directly through their website. It was my first time in Chicago, and we were looking forward to hitting the Thanksgiving sales.After a long and boring flight from the UK, we arrived at the hotel early. However the staff at the front desk managed to find us a room that was ready.We had a slight mix up at check in over the price of the room, but Tim managed to sort it out straight away. We booked a magifecent double, and compared to UK hotels it was huge. It was lovely and clean, warm and welcoming. We had a coffee maker and microwave, (which came in very handy, as we arrived on Thanksgiving and all the restuarants were closed.There is also tea and coffee available at no extra cost 24 hours a day from the breakfast area on the 2nd floorThe hotel is the perfect base for entertainment and shopping.Starbucks one one corner, Bed bath and beyond and Jewel Osco on the opposite corner, Walgreens a couple of blocks away.Michigan ave and State street a few minutes walk.Just around the corner is the free Navy Pier trolley stop, and the CTA Red Line.I needed some bus and train information, because I had not taken my laptop I wasn't quite sure how to find the information I needed, the staff were more than happy to print me off some schedules from the PC'S at the front desk.All in all we had a lovely stay and would recommend the hotel to everyone. If I go back to Chicago again, this will be my number one choice\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 20 2005\\tClean but tiny!\\tI have stayed at many choice hotels in the past and I would have to say that I was disappointed in this one. The location is great! We only stayed one night as we were in Chicago to see a taping of the Oprah Winfrey Show. We got in about 10:30 at night and checked out at 6:40 the next morning so we spent very little time in the room. The room was one queen size bed and the room was not much wider than the bed. I have only seen rooms this tiny in Europe. I tried to book directly through the hotel but they would not take a reservation for only one night. I believe there was a convention or something. Therefore I booked through another website (ratestogo). It was the best deal I could find for the Magnicifient Mile in Chicago for that date. I believe the total came to $108 plus taxes. We parked in the recommended garage at $21 a night. However, you can only leave your car there until 12:00 noon the day of checkout. The guy working behind the counter let us leave our vehicle in the garage until 3 so we could shop a little after the taping and gave a different transponder to get the car out. You have to go outside the hotel to get to the garage. There was a tv in the room with cable but the picture was not even watchable. Since we were only there a few hours, it was not a big issue but was disappointing nonetheless. There is a continental breakfast served each morning starting at 7 am. Since we had to be at Harpo Studios by 7 a.m. (about $10 cab ride including tip from this hotel), I wasn't sure they would have anything set up. The gentleman in charge of breakfast had starting setting it up and my friend, myself and a business traveller were able to grab something to eat (muffins) but the beverages were not yet set out. I had previously stayed at the Raphael in March as it was cheaper but their parking (valet) is more expensive at $38. If I had it to do over again, I would stay at the Raphael, because the valet parking was worth it. The person I travelled with uses a motorized scooter and the valet parking would have been more convenient and the overall price would have been a couple of dollars cheaper. The Comfort Inn is in much better condition. than the Raphael as it has been recently remodeled and is very clean and also has a pool which I did not see. However, we had a much larger room and two double beds at the Raphael which made it more comfortable.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Oct 22 2005\\tHighly recommended!\\tWe stayed for the second time at the Comfort Inn in August 05. This time we upgraded to a king which was much more spacious than the queen room we had stayed in the previous time. As before, everything was clean, updated and contemporary. The room was very comfortable and quiet, and staff was helpful. The continental breakfast was a definite bonus since we could eat on our way out in the morning and not have to worry about eating that meal out. The location is terrific - between State St. and Michigan Ave. - and close to the subway stop too. I have no complaints whatsoever, and the price is great for downtown Chicago and the added amenities of a jacuzzi and breakfast. Terrific stay all around.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 2 2005\\tGreat Location! Very nice but...\\tI can not say nothing negative about the hotel itself, very clean. It was in an excellent area - close to everything. We ate at the Weber Grill just around the corner, walking distance, and the food was excellent. However I was very upset about my request for no smoking rooms, we booked 2, one for us and one for my mother in law, and I was told that they only had one available when we checked in. I had taken the time to call the day before to confirm everything and I was very very upset that the staff didn't appear to understand that smoking rooms for asthmatics is a no no. I would stay there again but I'd call every day prior to my stay and write down names of who I talked to about my request of a no smoking room.\\t\\n\",\n",

For a reasonable price, we had a very comfortable suite and the maid's service was exceptional. The reception staff were pleasant and helpful. From E.

       " \"Jul 21 2005\\tExcellent Downtown Option\\tWe stayed 4 nights July 16-20. 2 adults and 3 children ages 12-17. Very pleasant stay and very pleased with the entire experience. The high ratings are well deserved. I would stay here again.Location: Outstanding! Many great restaurants and attractions are within easy walking distance. We enjoyed Webers Grill, Pizzeria Uno, and Lawreys all within a block or two. Numerous other options available as well. Michigan Avenue and shopping very close. Close to transit service options. Hotel: Excellent. It was very clean, fresh art-deco styling. Parking garage $21/day with transponder to allow in/out access as desired. Room: Excellent. We stayed in a &quot;magnificent double&quot;. The room had a wet bar, microwave, refrigerator, internet access (not wireless though), safe, coffee maker, iron, nice radio/CD/alarm. It was spacious for a non-suite room. Room for a roll-away bed, which was quite comfortable, not the typical bar-in-the-back style. The double beds were of satisfactory Serta quality. They were generous with their pillows which I found refreshing. The room was very clean and nicely lit. Our room was in the back of the building, which afforded no view at all, but was very quiet and free of street noise and lights.Amenities: Very good. The complimentary continental breakfasts were very nice, food was fresh. Coffee/tea available all the time. Fitness center is onsite, but we did not have time to utilize this. Sauna and whirlpool. No pool.Staff: Excellent. All were very friendly and helpul. They all seemed to smile. Some went out of their way to be of assistance without expecting anything in return. The few times we needed something (roll-away, extra towels, Yellowbook), someone brought them to our room within moments, no wait at all, the fastest service I've seen at any hotel ever.Price: Excellent. It is one of the least expensive options downtown, yet provides accomodations and service that could rival the much more expensive options. Negatives: very few. The air conditioning was weak, but then again it was around 96F every day. No view (but very quiet). A little hard to see the hotel sign from a distance (hotel is on the right side of this one way street).This is not an extravagant hotel, which makes it a very cost effective option. Those desiring a fancy hotel with extensive amenities would be disappointed. The service rivaled even the most expensive hotels I've stayed in. Those like us, looking for reasonable accomodations and a base from which to explore the attractions available in Chicago should be very pleased.\\t\\n\",\n",

Everything name-brand is right there!Inside the hotel, I found an eager staff running a tight ship.

A previous reservation to another downtown Suites establishment was cancelled after reading their reviews. Found a good rate here ($109) through the Chicago CVB (877chicago). Lobby and breakfast area are very small, but adequate; front desk staff appeared to be big-town-stuffy. Asked for a room with a view upon checkin, ended up on the 13th floor with 2 windows, but not much view. Room was exceptionally clean!! Very quiet place to be in the middle of a big city. Breakfast was above average. Location was prime with only 1/2 block to subway, 2 blocks to Michigan Avenue and several good restaurants within a block: Weber's Grill, ESPN Zone, California Pizza Kitchen, Big Bowl, Rock Bottom Brewery, etc. Also ventured 5 blocks west to find several more noteworthy restaurants, including Gino's East (excellent deep dish pizza). I'd recommend not driving here and paying the high parking rates downtown -- I traveled everywhere I wanted to go via the CTA (Wrigley Field, Sears Tower, US Cellular Field, and other Chicago destinations). 5 day unlimited pass was only $18. I'll come back to the Comfort.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 11 2005\\tFront desk service needs improvement\\tWe just returned from a trip to Chicago and stayed 3 nights at this hotel. It was difficult to find the hotel at first because the sign was hidden by other much larger signs in the area.Overall, it was very nice, clean and it was within walking distance to Michigan Ave, the Art institute and a number of great restaurants. We had no problems with the size of the room or the breakfast. For the price, it was great.What left us with a sour note was the parking issues. The front desk gave us a transponder to use with in/out priveleges at a daily discount rate. I thought this was great until I tried getting in. The transponder didn't work so I grabbed a ticket and told the front desk of the problem. They said I wasn't using it properly and they weren't very helpful(ie. they weren't willing to change the transponder). The next time I tried, I couldn't get the car out but someone was there to help open the gate. I also had problems getting the car back in so I talked to the front desk again(same two people). Once again, they weren't willing to exchange the transponder with another one. After some frustrating moments, we left the car in the garage until we checked out. This time, the garage security pulled me aside(because the gate wouldn't open) and I had to wait until they checked their computer records. After about 5-10 minutes and explaining that I wasn't a &quot;negligent&quot; monthly holder but was a visitor, I was allowed to go.Anyhow, if you don't drive, you will not have a problem with your stay.\\t\\n\",\n",

We were able to get the best price directly from the hotel's website. The hotel was such a great surprise for the price we paid. I think it's one of the few near Michigan Ave to offer a free continental breakfast. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The rooms were small but nice and clean. Sheets were soft and the queen bed had five pillows! Although I think some rooms look into a brick wall, our room had a street view, where we could see Bloomingdale's Home Store and one of many Starbucks. The hot tub was a nice break from a cold and snowy day. Make sure to catch the FREE Navy Pier Trolley in front of the Rock Bottom Brewery just a couple blocks away. We would definately stay here again!\\t\\n\",\n",

I decided to stay there after looking at numerous hotels in the loop and downtown area of Chicago because it seemed like a good price for a hotel in that area. This hotel definitely did not disappoint. The entire hotel was very nice, with up-to-date decor and furnishings throughout. Staff was professional and accomodating, and our room was clean and in great condition. Continental breakfast was adequate with bagels, danishes, muffins, oatmeal, cereal, french toast, fruit and drinks. For a hotel this well-kept in this area, the price is terrific too. My only complaint, if any, was that our room was smaller than anticipated and it looked over a parking garage. The hotel was located a block from the subway (red line) and perfectly situated in between Michigan Ave. and State St. I doubt there's a nicer hotel for a better price in the loop area. Also, we found the best price directly through the hotel's website rather than any of the travel sites.\\t\\n\",\n",

Helpful staff - Fridge/micro couple tv's 2 phones bdrm and sitting room nice bath comp breakfast european continental. Motel entry in exact middle of block. Each corner of your block sports outstanding food- Weber's Grill and Chicago's own Pizzaria Uno. I am telling you one can't do better than this motel for less money. Nice full size high power jaccuzzi tub at bsmt level with small equipped fitness center. Drug store/grocery 1/2 block walk from motel door. Oh yea - had another reservation for sunday-monday at the park hyatt for 3 times the money also and AGAIN cancelled res and did not move to the other motel for the last two days.

Got a rate of $103/night off of Orbitz. We had a queen room, kind of small - but well kept and clean. Free high speed internet was a bonus - just make sure to bring a cat 5 cable, as I thought it would be wireless - so had to rent one for $2 per day from the front desk - no big deal. Weber Grill breakfast buffet was so-so, (tried it after seeing it recommened in other reviews on tripadvisor) - it's better when you make them make stuff fresh from the grill - then it was worth it. Make sure to park in the lot just N of the hotel (big green Parking sign) - $16/night and then $10 after that. It was great - easy location to both the CTA buses and the L. Anyway - to sum it all up - I would stay here again, no doubt, and this was our first time to Chicago as well - so no jaded review here about it not being a 5 star hotel - just needed a good place to stay and this did it. \\t\\n\",\n",

The location was the best part, we had our car when we needed it, plenty of walkable sights to get to, and plenty of taxis to catch right outside the lobby. The rooms themselves were very nice too. Although small, it was perfect, be aware there is not much of a view from this hotel, we were on the 15th floor and overlooked brick windows, but it didn't matter to us, we were there to enjoy the city. The bed was very comfortable, the room was quiet, the lighting and decor was contemporary and beautiful. One minor problem was the shower the first day had very little water pressure and little hot water, I thought we would just have to deal with it, but by the next day the water pressure was up and there was plenty of hot water. The breakfast was perfect too, extremely nice decor there and wide selection. We would definately stay here again.

This hotel is in a great location, walking distance to everything, good restaurants, shopping, a local market... if your there to see the Bears or the Cubs transportation is just minutes away. We would definatly stay here again. The continental breakfast is great too!!!\\t\\n',\n",

       " \"Nov 13 2009 \\tThis hotel was what I'd expect from a Hyatt- in EASTERN EUROPE!\\tI didn't book this hotel, a family member did as a bunch of us flew in for a wedding. If I had to spend more than 36 hours there I would have left for somewhere else. This hotel, which I actually saw on some websites had 5 stars, was a dump. It was more like staying in a college dorm than a hotel. The room smelled. The carpet was gross and old. There was no real closet. The worst part was they didn't have a fitted bedsheet for the mattress- they put a top sheet on for the bottom sheet, which of course slid off anytime you moved. The room was just disgusting.When we checked in Friday night, about 830, we were hungry, but the resaurant was closed (except for the bar). We did eat at the restaurant for breakfast, and it was actually good (great pancakes)- the only good part of the whole hotel.The hotel is only close to the convention center. EVERYTHING else is a cab ride. They have a one-way shuttle downtown, but only leaves every hour. When I inquired about it, the concierge didn't know the times it left and didn't tell me that I could make a reservation for it (fortunately my family member found out and reserved us seats or that would have been another cab fare).Overall, for this same money I've stayed in Marriott Courtyards and Hampton Inns 10x as nice. This place was just horrible.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nov 6 2009 \\tI got stuck in a small corner room\\tJust not a great location for Chicago. I moved hotels after two nights to a Marriott that was very central off of Michigan Ave for the same price. The room I got stuck in was pathetic for a Grand Hyatt Hotel.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 23 2009 \\tExcellent convention hotel\\tAs many before me have mentioned, this is a great hotel for the convention center - you don't even have to go outside. If the reason for your trip is a convention, then I think it's the best possible choice. I attended a conference in Chicago and stayed at this hotel as well as the Hyatt Regency on Wacker (the Hyatt Regency Chicago). I think of the two the McCormick Place Hyatt is more modern and has probably been more recently updated. The room was very clean, the room design was more current, and the bathroom fixtures were newer. On the other hand, I think the service at this hotel was perhaps not as serene as at the Hyatt on Wacker - I had longer waits to speak with the concierge/front desk at the McCormick Place Hyatt, and I got some &quot;I don't knows&quot; from the front desk in response to questions they should have been able to accommodate. One example was when we inquired regarding the Metra, which is the closest public transportation option to our hotel - they didn't have any schedules on hand and could not tell us anything about using it. Another example - I left an item in my room when I checked out, and one of my colleagues who was still in the room brought it down to be mailed to me and filled out a FedEx slip with my name and address. Due to a lack of communication between the front desk and the packing departments, however, calls to the front desk about my item the next day got a response that they didn't know anything about it. After calling back again, and speaking to shipping, where it turns out my item would have languished until I managed to get connected to someone who knew something about it, they finally took my credit card information and sent my item, which I have since received. I am inclined to attribute some of this confusion to the fact that many people were checking out the day I did, and I had confidence that this issue would eventually be resolved satisfactorily, but I think the front desk could strive to emulate the focus on service that the Hyatt on Wacker demonstrated to me during my stay there.That said, for attending a conference in Chicago I wouldn't stay anywhere else.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 20 2009 \\tGreat views great staff\\tI showed up kind of tired at the desk last Friday night and the woman who checked me in somehow intuited that I needed a break. She was a lifesaver... gave me a gorgeous room (2533) which was a corner suite with breathtaking views on three sides. I spent the first night just glued to the windows, enjoying room service with a friend in an equally gorgeous room, and and watched the world go by. I called the desk to thank the womderful agent who gave me this blissful room but she was gone by the time I did it... and now I forget her name. I fell badly about that. She was a fantastic employee, Hyatt. People like this keep me coming back to your properties.The hotel is like McCormick Place... big, busy and self-contained. I can't say enough about my room, which was truly so lovely that I hated to leave it. I never even went into Chicago! The hotel restaurant was okay... my meal was fair enough although perhaps not quite as good as it could have been. The waiter messed up the order, for example, noticed that he had brought the wrong things, and then walked away without correcting it. That was odd. But this is to quibble when I could go back to the beautiful room and watch the fireworks over the Navy Pier. And the meeting rooms were good, the food at the meetings very high quality, and it was comfortable in every way.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 16 2009 \\tMediocre...not worth the price!\\tThe good: Housekeeping was superb. The clothes I accidently left on the bed were folded and placed on the desk. The hotel connects to the convention center. If you're attending a conference, it's nice to get to the conference in under 5 minutes. The lobby is pretty modern/nice and full of extensive groups of comfortable couches--perfect for doing work or meeting with others. The bad: the walls are SUPER THIN--my neighbor's 2am shower sounded as if it were from my room. You can hear everything from the hallway--from people closing doors to full conversations. Good thing I'm a sound sleeper! The cable wasn't working for half of my trip (likely due to rain-satellite TV I assume). The fitness center (which isn't as extensive as Hyatt boasts) was completely packed each morning between 7-9am. I couldn't get on any of the bikes, elipticals or treadmills. Finally, the rooms were just okay. Nothing spectacular (great views from the top floors facing north). The ugly: NOTHING IS INCLUDED and the ammenities are massively expensive. Internet (which has cut out on me 3x since starting this review) is 10 dollars per day; if you want high speed cable internet, it will cost you 15 dollars per day. Drinks at the bar were 11-14 dollars for well drinks, water/soda is 2.50+ tax, and use of a computer or printer at the business center is about 10 dollars. Because nothing is around the hotel (and the surroundings are a bit sketchy), you're really stuck on paying for highly overpriced room service or ordering delivery. When you factor in a high price per night, you can easily expect to pay 300 dollars per night to stay here. In all, I would recommend this hotel for those who don't care about price and want to stay literally in the convention center. Keep in mind that a taxi here from downtown is 12-15 dollars each way and there is also METRA service and tons of bus service to the convention center. So, if you don't mind 10-20 min travel time, staying at a nicer and cheaper hotel downtown may be your best bet for the money. Hope this helps!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 14 2009 \\tthe hotel itself looks great but location and shuttle are horrible\\tthe hotel and room are clean and new and moden. no question about that.

       " 'Oct 11 2009 \\tGreat stay!\\tWe booked our trip through priceline and got a great deal on our room. Upon entry, the hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly. Our surprise came when we saw our room. We were on the 15th floor and had a beautiful view of the Chicago skyline!!! The room was very clean- the toiletries were a nice touch (toothpaste, soaps. etc). The only main problem we ran into was parking. I had called prior to our visit and the woman told me that we could do self park with in and out priveledges for $27. When we tried to leave to go into town for dinner, we were charged to leave. We spoke with the front desk and they told us that we were misinformed and that we could try and ask the valet if we could switch to that.. We waited outside for 10 minutes and no one was out there, so we left and paid. The drive to downtown was short and convenient.Another problem was that there were no vending machines for late night drinks! We ended up ordering a pizza with soda around 1 am from a local pizza place. The hotel was very clean and upscale. We loved it! My boyfriend proposed to me here, so I love it!!!!!!!!!!!\\t\\n',\n",

       " \"Oct 8 2009 \\tNice hotel a little pricey but it is Chicago.\\tStayed here for 2 nights in October 09 for a convention taking place at the McCormick place convention center connected to this hotel. I'll tell you, it's very convienent to be at this hotel for conventions but I'm not sure why you'd want to stay here for any other reason.The hotel itself is nice, clean and spacious. The lobby is beautiful. The rooms are well appointed with flat screens and good views if you get a room over the 12th floor or so. The bed was comfortable, tons of soft pillows, and there was the option to buy bottled water in the room for $2/bottle (16oz). The same bottles were being sold down in the gift shop for $3 ea. One other thing I really liked was that the elevators were quick and efficient. What I didn't like was:$19 breakfast buffet (at Shor) with nothing special in it (eggs, bacon, pankcakes, sausage, fruit, etc)$27/day to park ($37 w/ in and out)I wish the room was a little more soundproof - could hear TV in the next room over and talking in the hallway.Very expensive room rate when there are tons of deals close by on S. Michigan Ave.It's also a little away from the action in Chicago with almost all bars, restaurants, etc being at least a $8 cab ride away each way.Economy internet was $10/day with a faster option available for slightly more.These are the prices you can expect at all the major players in Chicago so I won't take off too many points for their prices.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 5 2009 \\tAll's well that ends well\\tI took my family with me on a business/leisure trip. We arrived at the hotel after 7 pm to find they did not have any standard rooms. Apparently one of their guest decided to stay another day. The hotel offered to take us to another location or give us the living room section of a suite. We took the suite because we were tired and my convention started the next morning. Although the room was large w/a wet bar, the rollaway beds they provided did not offer a restful sleep for anyone in our party. I complained to the front desk the next day and they immediately moved us to another room, gave us 3 breakfast vouchers, a bowl of fruit and complimentary water. We also received a letter of apology from the hotel Manager and a phone number to call if we needed to. The room was wonderful! We had a lovely view of the lake and downtown. Although the hotel is far from downtown, they have a free shuttle that will take you to tourist sites. Kudos to the staff who made the rest of our stay enjoyable. This review is a little late in coming but i wanted to make sure they were thanked\\t\\n\",\n",

       " 'Sep 17 2009 \\tGreat benefits and View\\tFrom the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty! It was easy to access the hotel from the highway and the parking garage was easily accessed for self parking. Check in went smoothly, we had reserved as part of a Summer Package and received a room w/ a city/lake view on the top floor! Also as part of the package was free self park and free wireless internet. The concierge was very helpful and recommended a place for dinner. We did see a show, &quot;The Color Purple&quot; at the Arie Crown Center in McCormick Place and getting to and from the show was extremely easy and completely indoors. The hotel does offer a free shuttle to the Mag. Mile but it only leaves on the hour and only has 14 seats so it was booked for any time that we wanted to go. Taxi to the Mile depending on where you are going is $10-15 each way. The room was a fair size and clean. The decor was slightly older but in good shape. Our view from 3313 was AMAZING! We could see Navy Pier, the marina and several of downtowns buildings. The beds at the Hyatt hotels are wonderful and we never have a hard time sleeping:) I did use the Fitness Center and it was very nice and accessible 24 hours. The only downside of this hotel for me is that it is a little out of the way for what I am usually doing in Chicago. I would definetely stay here again though!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 27 2009 \\tClean and comfortable at a great price\\tThis is a great hotel and they frequently have great price discounts available through Priceline. The staff is very courteous and they go out of their way to help you enjoy your stay. The hotel is very clean from the lobby/check-in to the rooms. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were quite large for a standard hotel room. There were also great amenities like Aquafresh toothpaste and great shampoo/conditioner. I would have to say that this hotel is a bit out of the way. It's close to the convention center which is near Soldier Field. It's about a $10 cab ride into the city and believe me that cab ride is worth it for the deal you get here. The hotel also has an hourly shuttle to take you into the city. I would suggest to the hotel that this become a half hour shuttle as it can fill up quickly and also, it's easier to plan your day if you can leave on a more flexible schedule.Overall I would definitely stay at this hotel again when visiting Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 25 2009\\tWonderful Anniversary Weekend At Hyatt Mccormack Place Chicago\\tMy wife and I recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary and what better a city to do that in than Chicago. We booked using Priceline and got a favourable rate. I contacted the hotel to advise them that this was a special occasion for us and inquired if an upgrade would be possible.On check-in we were greeted by &quot;Happy Anniversary...we have upgraded you to a suite.&quot; Music to our ears. And what a suite...it had about 1,000 sq. ft. about the size of a small condo. The view of Chicago's shoreline was amazing. The staff...each and every one went out of their way to be helpful.We used valet parking which was a bit steep at $38. per day but the valet service was both prompt and curteous. One last thing about the hotel...their bar on the main level was warm and welcoming for a nightcap.Several days we did not use the car at all. No problem, the #3 bus stops right in front of the hotel and runs right up Michigan Ave. to most key tourist attractions. During the week service is very frequent...less so on weekends. You can get a travel pass for unlimited Chicago Transit Authority travel for use on both busses and subway. Using the subway...red line involves a non user friendly walk to/from the subway station. The #3 bus is a much better bet.Two suggestions for visitors who may not have visited this wonderful city in a long time...1. Tave the Architectural River Cruise- great. 2. Have dinner at Old Town Brasserie - the food, service, and piano player were all great. Super wine list as well.Hope you enjoy as much as we did.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 15 2009 \\tOnly good if you have bussiness at McCormick Place stay elsewhere otherwise.\\tLocation, location, location. If you are attending an event or exhibiting at McCormick Place its a good place to stay, because you don't have to deal with parking each day and can simply walk from the hotel to the convention center without even going outside. However, as a hotel for seeing chicago, its to far from downtown, which means you will have to take expensive cabs just to get to the typical tourist attractions. Also, there is an incredible lack of dinning options after midnight (not even a vending machine and nothing within walking distance of the hotel), so if you are coming in late to the hotel, be sure to eat before you get there!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 9 2009 \\tSolid hotel but the location was not to my liking\\tThis is a pretty decent hotel, but I prefer to be a little more north. Most of the better destinations in Chicago are a few miles north of this McCormick Place location. This hotel has an excellent location to Soldier Field, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, and the Field Museum .. so that was a positive. They offer shuttle service to various spots, so the location might not be much of a problem for everybody. All told though it was a great bargain for me as I was able to secure a room for $77 per night thru Priceline, but in the future I will look to stay a little north of this location.I had a nice stay though, and I would recommend this hotel ... especially to those that plan on hitting the destinations I mentioned earlier, and for those that have business dealings in or around McCormick Place.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 6 2009 \\tHyatt Name WITHOUT Hyatt 4-Star Quality\\tI stayed at this hotel for the Rock-N-Roll Chicago Half Marathon and although it was a somewhat nice enough hotel, its definitely NOT hyatt 4-Star Quality. This hotel deserves a 3Star at best (3.5 is pushing it). There was sitting water in our bathtub, the room was warm upon check in, the pillows on the bed were stained and the renovations mentioned on their site werent apparent (the wall paper in our bath room was peeling off the wall). The bathrooms are EXTREMELY small. We requested another room and were told there were none available and after calling several times and going back to the front desk, another room was provided for us which makes me feel like we were lied to because just 10mins before that there was &quot;nothing available&quot;. I wouldnt suggest this hotel to anyone. Also it is far from all of the &quot;Michigan Ave&quot; attractions, you'll need a cab or bus to get ANYWHERE except the convention center which is attached to the hotel. Its an optimal hotel for business travel but i wouldnt chose to stay here again otherwise. If youre a hyatt fan, i'd opt for Hyatt Regency Chicago!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 4 2009 \\tChecking in and parking are ridiculous but rooms are nice and comfortable\\tWe stayed here for a long weekend in Chicago with our three kids. We tried to secure our rooms an hour before check in...at most hotels you can check in, secure your rooms, but then simply wait until official check in to get your keys while the rooms are being prepared. At this hotel, this is impossible. During a very busy day, they made everyone wait around in the lobby until 3pm. It was packed with people. Why not just check everyone in, and then have them wait to get the key only? Then those who got there early have a better chance of getting the room type requested? As it was for us, we had kids with us and waiting in a packed space is trouble, so we left to go to the aquarium. By the time we came back we were on SEPARATE FLOORS. We were told the next day they would automatically move us to new, connected rooms. Nope. We had to come up and request it again, making us wait to find new rooms, and then wait for our luggage. On top of that, people should know that parking is extremely high and if you want to use a car at all, that you are forced to use valet for in and out privileges for $38 a day or your parking is $27 each and every time you leave. Thankfully, the front desk people are kind (it's not their fault the check in system and parking is stupid), but it was a hassle.Contrary to a lot of reviews, the hotel's location isn't terrible at all, depending on why you are there. If you want nightlife and downtown, this is possible if you drive or take the bus, but if you are there for museums like we were, it's good. It's within walking distance of The Field Museum, Soldier Field, Shedd's Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, and 12th Street Beach, next to public transportation (the #3 bus pulls up right in front of the hotel), and has many places to eat nearby within walking distance or a short drive. Chinatown is a few blocks down Cermak Street. Checking out didn't work via television, so again we had to wait in line to check out. Also, although they have three kiosks available for checking in and out, none of them were ever working. Also, no free internet. No wi fi at all. Only a for-pay ethernet cable was available. The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, and our view was beautiful. The hotel is perpendicular to the lake so if you are on any of three sides of the hotel, you get an awesome city AND lake view. I just wish it wasn't so much of a hassle to do simple things.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " 'Jul 14 2009 \\tPerfect for the business traveler\\tAs I read the previous reviews, I was a little concerned. I was going to be spending a week in this hotel for a conference. I was actually considering a different hotel. I contacted their customer service rep by e-mail and outlined my concerns. I needed a reliable internet connection. I needed a no-smoking room, on a no smoking floor (asthma), I needed a refrigerator in the room (medicine) I needed enough space in the room or at the bell stand for a scooter. I was assured by an e-mail response the next day that none of the above was a problem. I arrived early and was checked in immediately. The room was clean, spacious, and exactly what I needed. Some might quibble that it was not up-to-date but just give me a great bed, a desk with a task chair, a chair or couch for comfortable reading and be clean. A big plus was the state- of-the-art gym with plenty of treadmills and bicycles. (and towels)The housekeeping staff was generous with towels and de-caf coffee for the in room machine. The place was packed with my compatriots and really it is perfect if you are going to be at the Convention Center, just an elevator ride and an enclosed walkway away.The service was consistent. The staff really got that those people were anxious to get to their meetings but also needed breakfast. The wait staff was friendly; the food in the hotel restaurant was fresh and fast. The coffee came in a press and the tea was a premium brand with a pot.So here we are the last night. Dropped stuff off at the package room. The person manning the room was efficient and keen on detail.And yes, the public bus for $2.25 picks up right in front of the hotel for a trip to the museum or downtown. If you are an experienced business traveller, I pretty sure that you will be content with this choice as my friend who checked out this morning said, this is a hotel that really gets what we need.And yes, a clean fast internet connection as I send this recommendation.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jul 7 2009 \\tGreat Hotel\\tWhat can I say, it is a Hyatt. We were on the 10th floor (1002) on 4th of July and could see about 6 to 8 different fireworks shows put on by the smaller communities of Chicago. I liked that the hotel was away from the crowds. It costed about $15 to get to the Navy Pier by taxi. They also offer a shuttle service on the hour. You have to sign up for it ahead of time. It gets full quick, so as soon as you check in you may want to get your name on the sheet. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was huge. I am very happy with my stay here.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 18 2009 \\tGreat Bargain\\tI stayed at the Hyatt Regency for 1 night in June on a Saturday when I went to watch the USvHonduras World Cup Qualifier. PRICE:$85 plus tax on Priceline.com was well worth it. (there was three of us staying at the hotel so it helped even more).ROOM:Room was crisp and clean. Neatly cut blue and white linens on the bed, large flat screen TV. Pseudo bathroom where the sink was out side of the bathroom itself (sort of like a large water closet where the toilet and shower was behind the door). Room wasn't huge but it came with a double bed. We didn't stay in the room very long, just a place to clean up, store our stuff, and sleep for a couple of hours before an early morning flight.LOCATION:About a 10 minute walk from soldier field, couldn't ask for a better location to support events at the stadium. Easy access to downtown Chi-Town.AMENITIES:Didn't see much in the way of newspapers or extras. We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment much on that. The one problem I had was I couldn't connect to the high-speed internet or it wasn't available. SERVICE:Staff was pleasant and efficient. Checked-in and out with ease. Overall, from my limited stay, I would recommend this hotel. It definitely felt like a business hotel as it was attached to a convention center but for one night from Priceline, it's top notch in my book.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 17 2009 \\tStay closer to downtown\\tStayed here to go to Cubs game and then hang out in downtown area afterwards. There were 6 of us and no minivan taxis so we all crammed into one taxi. Was so far from downtown area we didn't go back there to change clothes because it would have cost to ride a taxi back and forth. If you are planning on being downtown for your outings my advice would be to find something downtown instead. We paid around $90 for our room. I'm guessing you could find something for same price but with more convenience. Took a limo back to hotel and the driver couldn't even find our hotel. It is a very nice hotel but just too far from everything. Self parking is $27 and valet is around $38.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 16 2009 \\tThanks for making our first Chicago trip a good one.\\tWe got a great deal through Priceline on this hotel. We were a bit concerned at first because of the location on the &quot;South-side&quot;. Those fears are unwarranted as you probably won't be walking anywhere from this hotel. The location is a bit distant from downtown, causing you to rely on public transportation a lot. However the hotel offers a free shuttle that takes you downtown. You are on your own getting back, but just grab the #3 bus and it drops you off right in front of the hotel. The shuttle driver was awesome! She even took us to the closest blue line station (to get to the airport) after we checked out, so we wouldn't have to pay for a taxi or fool with dragging our luggage on a bus. [I hope I don't get her in trouble for that, as that's not one of the shuttle stops. But there were only a couple people on the shuttle and it was on the way to downtown.] That's indicative of the overall service we received while at the Hyatt. Thank you Hyatt.The hotel has all the amenities you would need..room service, onsite restaraunts, pool, fitness center, concierge, etc. Very nice decor, comfortable and clean.My only complaint is the location, but if you plan accordingly it's not a big deal. It was our first trip to Chicago, so we weren't there to sit in a hotel. We got up and got going and didn't come back until the evening. We made sure to grab dinner before returning to the hotel, as there isn't much nearby, but we also ordered in from downtown restaraunts (Giordano's and a chinese place) and had it delivered with no problem. Hotel food is a bit expensive, but what hotel isn't? There's a McDonalds within walking distance down a few blocks and there's even one in the McCormick Place convention center if you need a meal in a pinch.We even got adventurous and walked back to the hotel one afternoon/evening from the Grant Park/Museum Campus area. It was only a couple miles, but stopping to grab dinner on the way and admiring the scenery made it enjoyable. We (myself, wife and 2 boys (8 &amp; 5) safe the whole way to the hotel (we took Michigan Ave to Ceremak).\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jun 16 2009 \\tWhen In Chicago Stay at the Hyatt at McCormick Place\\tI stayed at the Hyatt McCormick Place and was very impressed. The suite was beautiful, the views we outstanding. We were able to view a fireworks display at the Navy pier form our room on Saturday night - I wondered if Liz, the Guest Experience Manager, ordered that display for our party. Service was excellent, the suite was excellent and very roomy. The view of downtown Chicago and the lake were awesome. The staff was great and helped us out by providing extra trash cans in the room. We had a get together at my suite after the graduation, 30 people and tons of food fit easily. The staff helped us transport the supplies and food in and out of the hotel.It was an excellent location as I was attending an event at UoC. Access to downtown was very easy. I would very much like to stay here again. As a matter of fact, it was very hard to leave the room to head back home. LCD tv, great walk-in closet, nice living room area and very highly recommended!I want to thank Liz and the staff for making my stay a memorable and enjoyable stay.\\t\\n',\n",

       " \"May 21 2009 \\tthey care\\tLet's just say the front desk cares what you think about the place. So...upper management is doing its job.They take care of you when they mess up.Part of me wishes that they didn't mess up.The hotel plays the part however, it is 50 ft from the main lobby of the convention center. Beats the hell out of waiting for a shuttle.other stuff: walls are waaaay too thin, business center is clean but a rip off\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 21 2009 \\tAlmost Clean but great location\\tIf the first room I checked into was clean I would have been happier--the location couldn't be better for access to McCormick Place.The business center was useful, but I preferred the Kinko's in McCormick Place. I didn't take advantage of the Restaurants in the hotel--much prefer to check out some new places in Chicago.Parking seemed a bit expensive and honestly, why can't the staff read? If the sign says entrance and exit to the parking structure... why would they block it off and allow people to almost get into accidents.The room is modern but they should join the ranks of hotels providing free internet.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 20 2009 \\tClean but DEFINITELY not to Hyatt standards!\\tI attended the NRA trade show last weekend and stayed at this Hyatt for two nights. First, let me say that the public areas were very nice. The employees we came into contact with were FANTASTIC, especially at the front desk, housekeeping and gift shop/convenience store. Definitely a typical Hyatt experience - UNTIL you walk into the room. OMG. If you blindfolded me, took me into the room, took the blindfold off and asked me what hotel chain's room I was standing in I would have to say Holiday Inn. This is not to say that the Holiday Inn is in any way a terrible chain - but Hyatt standards are most definitely not met in these rooms. For the over $200 per night charged it doesn't even come close to being acceptable. The closet is even covered by a CURTAIN. There is no safe in the room (for a business hotel?), no magnification mirror (small annoyance), the towels were so thin and dare I even mention the toilet paper? I'm sure some prisons use softer toilet paper. Forget the coffee too - ugh, the room had the single serve piece of plastic junk coffee maker that drips out one cup of (horrible) coffee at a time in about 10 minutes. Most of the hotels at this price range also offer WIRELESS internet access (some without cost) but I was tethered to the desk and had to pay an additional $10 for 24 hours of internet access (or take my laptop over to the convention center where it is FREE). If you HAVE to stay here, it is convenient to the convention center and the rooms are kept very clean by a wonderful housekeeping staff. Perhaps it is because I am used to our Florida Hyatts that are impeccable and luxurious that I am aghast at this particular location. I saw many hotels in the downtown area that would put this hotel to shame - and it would cost the same to take a cab out to the convention as it did to take a cab out of the convention area to downtown (where there is absolutely nothing to do after the convention closes each day). If you have to pay more to stay downtown it would be well worth it - IMHO. Frankly, this should not be called a Hyatt - nice standard hotel, but not Hyatt.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 18 2009 \\tGreat Convention Hotel\\tStayed here for 4 nights during a tradeshow in March. Booked a standard king room and was upgraded to a Corner Suite (I am a Diamond member with Hyatt).Check-in was fast and efficient. The staff was friendly and very professional. For those attending a trade show at McCormick Place, you cannot beat the convenience of a 5 minute walk from your hotel room to the exhibition area.The rooms are very clean and up-to-date as far as modern furnishings go. (LCD tv, nice furniture, decorations). The bed is very soft and comfortable - perfect for resting after standing all day during a trade show. The bathroom is somewhat small, but great nonetheless. Noise was not an issue, although you could hear the occasional sound of doors closing in the hallway.The hotel is located right next to McCormick Place, which is situated south of the Chicago downtown area. If you're visiting as a tourist and have no business at McCormick, I recommend staying elsewhere. Otherwise, you will be spending money on taxi fare or spending 15-20 minutes walking to the downtown/Magnificent Mile area.I tried the breakfast buffet at the restaurant downstairs and it had a wide selection of good food with great service. The bar/lounge was ok but service was poor, most likely due to the large crowd of tradeshow visitors.I would stay here again only if I had to visit McCormick Place.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Apr 17 2009 \\tWorth staying at if you have business at McCormick Place\\tJust returned having attended a conference at McCormick Place. The hotel itself is clean and 4 star quality. There is a skywalk on the 2nd floor that leads right into McCormick Place so it made going back and forth very convenient. As other readers have pointed out, as long as you have business at McCormick Place, it is the place to stay at for sure. The only challenge is the hotel is not near anything else (I did discover a McDonalds about a 5-10 min walk). I did make the use of the hotel shuttle into town but it only runs up to 6 pm - it dropped me off downtown and I managed to take the bus back (the #3 bus by the way). Overall, I had a very pleasant experience.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Apr 11 2009 \\tDo not stay here unless you must be near convention center.\\tFirst the good. Bed was excellent, with very good pillows although sheets were thread bare. Good desk chair. good hotel if your entire stay is for convention next door and you just want a place to sleep while being at convention center.Negative: Not what you think of as a Hyatt. We were booked by mistake at this hotel, thankfully able to change to only for a one night stay. We could not wait to check out. Nearest restaurants are in Chinatown, a $7 taxi ride away, and they are poor. Would rate this hotel a 3* at best. Bellman watched us unload luggage from limo and place it on curb and only then did he offer assistance. Wall paper peeling in room and hall. Anywhere there could be dust, it was there. Drab, cheap decor, as previouly noted closet door is more like a shower curtain. Bath amenities (almost none) were 2 star, not 4 star at they think of themselves. The TV was neither a flat screen or HD (understand suites have hdtv) and it must have been as old as hotel, which I would guess is about 10 years. Internet so slow as to be almost unusable.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Apr 6 2009 \\tA good solid hotel if you're at McCormick Place\\tThe hotel is perfectly located for events at McCormick place. The rooms are clean and presentable (if not a little stodgy in their decor). The staff were perfectly helpful without being overbearing. The restaurant downstairs was good and the snack shop well stocked. No complaints there. The internet cable in the room is exceptionally short, bring a spare if you can. Business center is good, staff are again helpful. However, it is a real trek to get downtown for any entertainment or food. If you're at the McCormick and need to get some work done, it's perfect.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 31 2009 \\tLittle details make all the (annoying) difference\\tI'd like to thank previous reviewers for all of their tips. I brought with me plenty of snacks and (more importantly) a 25-foot long ethernet cord. This has really helped me.I was assigned to a beautiful suite (they must have been out of standard rooms). An amazing view of downtown Chicago and the water. Wow. And more room than the lower floor of my house.That being said, I can't believe such a fabulous room is marred by so many little annoyances. For one thing, not only is there no wireless, but the ethernet cable is short and located on the desk, so if you want to work on your laptop from the bed, bring a long ethernet cable of your own. Second, there are no easily accessible power outlets next to the bed (I generally like to plug in my iPhone and use it as a backup alarm in case the hotel one doesn't work)! Third, the walls really are paper thin (and I'm pretty noise tolerant in general)Finally, the sheets on the bed are weird - the bottom sheet is thin (so thin you can see through to the mattress0 and doesn't tuck under the head of the bed, and the sheets around the comforter don't seal. So, while I'm not one of those people who runs around with a UV-light, even I question whether this feels &quot;clean&quot;.On the bright side, they did supply a tube of toothpaste in the room, which is really nice. I like hotels that supply toothpaste and mouthwash (this one didn't supply the mouthwash) since bringing those 3 ounce bottles everywhere doesn't always work out for me.And, as I said, the view (at least from this room) was unbelieveable. Too bad I was there for a conference and couldn't enjoy it for very long.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 26 2009 \\tNot bad if you're exhibiting or attending a convention at McCormick\\tThe rooms are pretty solid and definitely for business travelers. If you are attending or exhibiting there, the convenience is unbeaten. They just added a mini-fridge which is good for those who like to stock their rooms during these trips. Do stock plenty of water since the air quality will dry you up like a prune during sleep. Unfortunately, they have not upgraded their TV's yet and have a terrible channel selection. The sauna, pool and gym is not bad at all for a business hotel. The concierge is pretty solid when they are around. They also have auto check-in and check-out but there is no flexibility with changing your room using the machine. The store at the hotel is a complete rip-off. Unlike many other midwest hotel stores, the mark-up is incredible - especially the booze and refreshments. The in-hotel bar provides the best value for the food there. There are many TV's at the bar just in case you are a sports fan. About the convention center, the food is slim pickins so be warned. For a normal lunch you will spend close to $20. They have a cafeteria with hot food which is the most expensive and a Connies and McDonalds on the lower level. Truthfully, the McDonalds is the only food establishment there that is not a complete rip-off. Tip - the taxi line is much shorter at the hotel entrance as opposed to the convention center entrance.\\t\\n\",\n",

The smoke stacks that came from just below our room took away from anything that would have been nice to see.Food was good, beds comfrontable and the overall stay was very nice.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Feb 1 2009\\tGreat Hotel but Overpriced \\tWe stayed here over New Year's 2009 to visit with some family. The hotel itself was very nice: excellent gym and pool, very nice rooms overall with plenty of space to work. The staff at the restaurant downstairs and the doormen were very friendly and helpful and got to know us after a day or two. The internet was $9.95/ day and you had to get on through an ethernet cable, which was really frustrating since there were two of us who needed to work from the room. There's really nothing nearby; we walked 2 blocks to a McDonald's, and that's the only thing at all close aside from the convention center, which was pretty deserted while we were there (over New Year's eve/ day). If you're going to a conference at the McCormick Place, this is probably a great place to stay, though as it's right by the convention center. It's really overpriced, which again goes with the conference thing. Overall, not a bad experience, but for price and location reasons it's clearly a hotel geared toward people attending conferences.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 7 2009 \\tOther guests' reviews right on the money!\\tI stayed at this hotel to attend a concert that was held at the Arie Crown Theater. Boy was I ever thankful that I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor about the hotel before I went to Chicago for the concert. First, this hotel is a smart choice if you're attending an event at McCormick Place. However, take heed about what other guests note in their reviews -- there are NOT any (underline any) amenities near-by the area outside of the hotel. This area is devoid of restaurants, sports bars, convenience/drug stores, gas stations, grocery stores, shopping, etc. This really surprised me because it seems to be an up and coming area. It really didn't matter that I was driving because I didn't want to take my car in and out of the parking garage because of the exorbitant parking rates. Besides, it was too late for me to jumping on buses or flagging down a cab just to grab a bite to eat. So I went without food until the next day. Now, sure I could've eaten in the hotel, but as other guests noted, the food was very pricey. So, plan ahead, be prepared and bring your own food, snacks and beverages if you stay at this Hyatt Regency. Or, you can hop a cab or the bus into downtown to grab a bite to me and have more choices. One other thing to note, the on-site restaurants close early. When I was walked to the concert around 8pm, all of the hotel's amenties were closed. This was confusing, especially since there was a concert going on next door. Guess they want to force you to order room service. The room was average. Walls are really, really paper thin (I could hear clearly the conversation of the guests next door). My view was spectacular. Fan for heater was very loud, but I had to have it on since temperature was single digit. As I said, if you're going to an event at McCormick Place, it's a good choice, but make sure you have food and snacks for after the event and when all of the on-site (and overpriced) amenties are closed.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 7 2008 \\tGreat fo Convention Center\\tStayed at the hotel for the CFA Exam, which was proctored in McCormick Place on Dec 5, 2008. I booked a &quot;winter getaway&quot; package for $161, for a standard room that included free parking. When I told them I was sitting for an exam, they automatically upgraded me to a large studio suite on the 22nd floor, with views of the loop and the lake. I know the area (this is not an area where most will want to roam around late at night), so I didn't go outside much. But for the use of the convention center, it was everything I could have hoped for. Great experience!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nov 13 2008\\tBe careful with your personal belongings-they will steal it\\tMake sure you never leave a cellphone visible in your room especially a blackberry as it will be stolen. Even a measly $5.00 bill lying around as it will be taken and the staff will explain to you that there is nothing that they can do about it as their professional lock down system shows that it is only you that had access to your room. It was a horrible experience when you know the housekeeping staff is keeping tabs on you. No consolation as you were looked at in the face that you were the liar in the situation. Staying at the Hyatt does not mean that you are staying at a 4 star hotel. The only convenience it has is the convention next door.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Nov 13 2008\\tReview...\\tPROS: Clean, nice rooms, comfortable beds, adjacent to convention center, good fitness center and pool. Restaurants staff excellent and friendly. I especially liked that just inside the room's door there was a place to sit and take off shoes.CONS: Not close to Chicago attractions, few restaurants nearby. Hotel shuttle only runs once an hour and only in the morning; it takes guests to specific tourist locales (no return trip offered), plus you have to sign up for the shuttle as space runs out quickly. Daily Grind was overpriced and the staff was a bit slow.OVERALL: Found staff to be friendly and helpful and hotel was fine. There was a bus stop right outside the hotel and the bus would take you right into downtown Chicago. This was a good way to travel but the hotel staff seemed hesitant to suggest public transportation.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 3 2008 \\tNice Room Bad Service\\tI guess I shouldn't complain much being that I paid $99/night through priceline for the room at this hotel attached to the Chicago convention center, and the room was clean and comfortable. Unfortunately service means a lot to me and the people I spoke to at this hotel just didn't seem to understand that they are in the business of hospitality. Maybe it was because it was a slow weekend for them and they weren't really on their A-game, but still, the rudeness, apathy, and attitudes I received from the stuff was unneccessary. I won't stay there again if it can be avoided.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 15 2008 \\tA mediocre convention hotel\\tThis is a pricey hotel in a dicey neighborhood with nothing nearby but the convention center and a cash-only McDonald's. If it had a decent restaurant and a cafe that stayed opened later than 6 p.m., then it might squeak by. But the cafe is very limited, the restaurant expensive and so-so and the hotel shop so limited in its selection it makes a newsstand look like a Walmart.If you are attending a conference at McCormick Place, stay elsewhere and take a cab. You'll pay no less than at this hotel, but you will at least be able to walk to places and enjoy a choice of restaurants.\\t\\n\",\n",

It's attached so you dont even have to go outside...Not to mention that you won't have to wait in the massive taxi lines that form for the McCormick Place.Hotel is extremely good...Great rooms + view of Chicago, nice fitness center, pleasant staff. They clearly take pride in their hotel.The downside of this hotel is that you have to taxi it if you want to head into Chicago. There's literally nothing nearby and while it's not a bad area (it's really close to Solider Field as well), it's deserted on the weekends and at night.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 11 2008 \\tServiceable but seek shelter elsewhere....\\tStayed here on a recent business trip despite the fact that I had no business at the convention center. The hotel is located on the south side of Chicago - much closer to Midway than to ORD. Got to the hotel early but they wouldn't check me in - i had a heck of a trouble trying to access the web thru my wireless &quot;air&quot; card - a theme that was repeated later on when i checked into my room.Hotel is clean and efficient - the room that i was checked into was on a high floor with a beautiful view south. Room was clean but not luxurious. No Wi-Fi in the room - i repeat - no wi-fi in the room. This is a convention center business person's hotel and there was no wi-fi. I have a wireless card that allows me to connect to the web anywhere i can get an att cell signal - but it did not work - i suspect the jam the signal so that you must buy their wired web service. Cab ride into downtown/loop area not a bad ride - the hotel even has a free shuttle service operated by a chatty woman. The hotel gym is very, very good. Lots of treadmills, free weights and machines. I did not use the pool tho it looked pretty good. Outdoor sun deck right by the pool/gym.No real reason to stay at this hotel unless you need the convenience during a convention - yes it is an OK hotel with some bright spots - but why subject yourself to this mediocrity? - t'man\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 10 2008 \\tUnderwhelmed\\tI'm here right now for a recruiting event and supposedly getting a &quot;deal&quot; for $250. I am not impressed. The room has a bit of an odd layout wherein as you enter the room, you immediately walk into an open bathroom vanity and closet &quot;door&quot; area. Actually it's not a closet door, but a essentially a closet shower curtain. There is a good-sized hole in the carpet behind the entry door revealing the concrete subfloor beneath. The sleeping area and bathroom area are separated by a weird partial wall. Not architectually interesting. Just a kind of strange. The walls seem to be pretty thin, too. Last night I was awakened by a some very loud laughing that seemed to be coming from the floor above me. I could hear sneezing in the room next to me. The halls and elevator area (at least on the 7th floor) are quite austere. Just carpet and walls. No furniture or decoration to be found. Lastly, the toiletry items. I groaned a little when I saw they were Portico products, which are exclusive (I think) to Hyatt. For the uninitiated, these have the scent of &quot;white ginger.&quot; I am not perfume-phobic, but this scent is so cloyingly sweet that my nose is tingling just thinking about it. It might appeal to some women, but I'd be surprised if any man would want to use it. I would suggest you bring your own soap (I've got some from the hotel I stayed in the day before, yes!) if you have issues with strong scents.\\t\\n\",\n",

The upside first, hotel is clean, my room offered a pretty nice view of Lake Michigan, the bed was quite comfy, the staff was nice, and it is attached to the convention center.The downside, there is nothing to do around this hotel and it is about a 10 to 20 minute cab ride from downtown depending on time of day, the hotel is in a tough neighborhood, if fact I advise people do not go outside at night except to get a cab. There is no need to go outside between the convention center and the hotel since they are attached and well secured. I was also pretty surprised to see a $9.95 per day fee to use the internet. In 2008 you would think this would be included in the room rate especially at $275.00 per night.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Oct 5 2008 \\tAmazing stay in a so-so neighborhood\\tI was upgraded to a suite at the McCormick Place, which was absolutely stunning. The view of downtown Chicago was phenomenal. Staff at the hotel were incredibly friendly; always willing to help out and anticipate your next move. Location of the hotel is not at all central and public transportation to the hotel is nonexistent. Not the fault of the hotel, but still a downside. Overall, a superb stay!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 2 2008 \\tWon't Be Back Unless I'm At A Trade Show At McCormick Place\\tI just finished spending three nights in this hotel for a trade show, and I must say, I'm less than impressed. Not with the staff -- service here is impeccable. Not with the view -- on the north side of the hotel the view of the Loop is incredible. The rooms are small but scrupulously clean, with nice furnishings and firm comfortable beds. The restaurants here are terrific as well.But complaints? I've got a few. For one: cheap fuzzy 25&quot; CRT TVs when flat panels are so inexpensive these days. Another: No microwave or fridge. This is a $220 room here! Another: virtually nothing to buy at the hotel convenience store. (You have to drive a mile north to a Jewel at Michigan and Roosevelt to lay in snacks, booze etc. for the room.) Another: stupid tiny useless pool. Another: virtually nothing to do in the immediate neighborhood. It used to be a total wasteland around McCormick Place, but the area is gradually filling in with housing, so hopefully soon shops and bars and restaurants will follow. (I mean, it's sad when there's way more to do around the convention center in DETROIT than there is in CHICAGO - and I should know, I'm from Detroit.) It's also weird that in a city with a really good mass transit system, there's no mass transit at this hotel or the convention center -- the only way out of here is expensive cabs.All told, the only reason to stay here is if you're hooked up with a trade show at McCormick, as I was. For regular pleasure travel to Chicago, go to the Loop, there's only about 500 better locations.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 3 2008 \\tmost hassle-free check-in and check-out ever\\tI recently spent one night at the Regency Hyatt McCormick Place while attending the Windy City Open DanceSport Competition held there. I thought that the rate was a good value. The room was well-appointed and comfortable, with a spectacular view of the Chicago skyline. The automated check-in (through a computer terminal in the lobby) and check-out (through the television screen in-room) were my most convenient and hassle-free check-in and check-out ever. I had dinner at the Shor restaurant, pricy but good. I was at the hotel less than 24 hours but wish I could've stayed longer and experienced more of the amenities.\\t\\n\",\n",

The staff was very friendly, with the exception of one of the concierge. The parking charge is a little ridiculous, but the valet guys were most helpful when telling us how to get around. The room was very clean and comfortable, but nothing spectacular. We ate at one restaurant for breakfast one morning and wished we had just gotten room service, since the price was the same ($55 for 2 adults and 1 child), although the staff there was very friendly and accommodating. We drove a few places, but bought a CTA card the last day and took the bus, el, and a water taxi around the city. It's not a long bus ride, and really the most economical choice considering you will pay minimum $14 downtown to park. If you can't stay right in town or in Grant Park, or if you are going to a convention at Mccormick place, this is not a bad choice, however, I would not pay the full price to stay there.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 14 2008 \\tInexpensive enjoyable hotel\\tI stayed at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place over the Lollapalooza weekend (August 1-3). I was there for the concert primarily, and to tour the city. I have to say, this hotel worked out quite well. The rooms were in good condition, though not outstanding. Services/prices were what I expect from a typical business/convention hotel: expensive and not worth my time. I didn't try the food, it was also on the pricey side. The room itself was incredibly inexpensive, especially considering the busy weekend. I paid under $100 a night thanks to PL, which, considering the other options, was a great value.So, now, as to the location. I had no issues with the location whatsoever. I used 3 different types of transportation to get from the hotel to different parts of Chicago:1. By bus. There is a bus stop just outside the Hyatt. Several buses run by the stop. The #3 bus will take you up Michigan Avenue north to the Mag Mile area. It takes probably about 10 minutes to get to Grant Park, and ~20 minutes to get up to near the Hancock Center, the end point of the route. The #21 bus will take you west to Chinatown, but more importantly, it will take you to the EL Red line in about 5 minutes, and from there you can easily go all over Chicago.2. By cab. Cab rides were fairly inexpensive and fast. I had no problem getting a cab, either going to or from the hotel. A ride from Grant Park cost $10, including tip. Very reasonable.3. By foot. While I didn't walk around the area at night, during the day I found it quite enjoyable on the lakeshore. The hotel is close to Soldier Field (if you are coming to see the Bears, this would be an excellent choice for location), and probably took me 10 minutes on foot. Also nearby is the Museum Campus area, so the Field Museum, the Alder Planetarium and Shed Aquarium. These three are probably another 5-10 minutes past Soldier field. Finally, walking to the Grant Park area would take roughly 30-35 minutes taking the scenic lakeshore route, or probably 5-10 minutes less taking a more direct street route. I would probably say the largest issue I had with the hotel was the surrounding area lacked in any and all ameneties. There were no close (10 minute walk) restaurants, bars, or any nightlife whatsoever. You would be looking at the Loop for that, at least. Still, for sightseeing Chicago, if you are the kind of person that takes off in the morning and stays out all day, I would say this hotel is an excellent fit. You will likely save a lot of money compared to downtown hotels and not miss a thing. If you plan on coming back to your hotel often to change/rest/etc, I would suggest something closer to the downtown area. Overall though, I was very pleased with my time here.\\t\\n\",\n",

The rooms are ok, clean, well furnished but a bit dull, and the coffee making facilities are wierd; 2 paper cups and a drip through machine-I wanted a kettle and china cups! The room was well serviced daily.The facilities of the hotel were ok, but expensive, breakfast cost is astonomical, although there is a small 'Starbucks' style outlet which is reasonable. There isn't much info about what is available in the centre-apparently there is a McDonalds somewhere but we never found it.The gym was superbly equipped, as was the pool.There is NOTHING you can walk to easily in the area -no shops, bars or restaurants-you really are stuck out in the midde of nowhere and due to time constraints, we always had to get a taxi into the centre of the city, at $15 dollars at time each way. I would take this cost into consideration if the hotel is cheaper than others located closer to the city. There was a bus stop just outside the hotel, I think it was the number 4, which took you right into the city.Chicago is a fantastic city, and we would reccommend anyone stay there: go to the cocktail bar in the Hancock tower at sunset, the architectural boat tour, check on booking a free walking tour with Chicago Greeters, fireworks, shopping along the Golden Mile and Water Tower. Superb trip!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jul 18 2008 \\tSubstandard service\\tI stayed here for 4 nights because of a conference in the adjacent conference center. The hotel is in an unsafe neighbourhood and one of my colleagues was mugged just outside the hotel. It is in general a nice property with a good-sized swimming pool, but not as nice as other Chicago hotels at this price. I was annoyed by the fact that there is an extra charge for the internet, that you have to pay hefty extra charges for tea/coffee, juice, toast etc. at the breakfast buffet, and that the room does not have a safe so you have to carry all your valuables around with you (a particular risk in this neighbourhood) or spend your day waiting for someone at the front desk to let you access their safe boxes.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jul 13 2008 \\tgorgeous downtown and lake front views!!\\tWe stayed at the Hyatt Regency on July 9th after we had decided at the last minute to stay in Chicago for 3 nights instead of 2. Although we only stayed at the hotel for 1 night out of the 3, we wished we could have stayed there all 3 nights!!! From the moment we walked inside, the hotel staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Everyone we met was extremely helpful and friendly. We stayed in room 1607, which had a gorgeous view of both downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan.The room was clean and very comfortable, the hotel was beautiful, and for us this was a great location, as we had brought our bicycles and spent the majority of our mini vacation cycling along the lake front. We also took the free shuttle to Navy Pier for the fireworks, and although there was a mix-up getting our names on the list, the staff made sure we were able to get on board.We will absolutely return to this great hotel!!\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jul 8 2008 \\tGreat views not so great service\\tFabulous views of the chicago skyline and lake Michigan make up for the poor service at this nicely decorated hotel. If you stay here, be sure to ask for a room on a high floor with great views of the city. I almost wanted to stay in my room and just stare out the window. Although this property is not on the loop, it still is located convenient to buses and the red line. Unfortunately, housekeeping in the rooms is poor as evidenced by dusty furniture. I returned from a day of sightseeing to find my room the same as I left it that afternoon. I requested cleaning and they sent someone quickly, but it was not a good job. It was worth the low convention price I paid of $109.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jul 1 2008 \\tDo Not Stay Here\\tWe were very disappointed in our recent stay at Hyatt Regency McCormick Place. 1) Furniture missing ( Ex. no chairs. They said they had been broken and not replaced) 2) Phone - You could call out but was broke and could not receive calls 3) The alarm clock was broke 4) No hot water in shower - For two days matter what time we tried the water was cold. Minor problems with room 1) Curtain for closet falling off 2) Our room was not ready until 1 hour after check in time Pros 1) Very accommodating staff in restaurant\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 25 2008\\tBest Staff We've Encountered!\\tWith an unmatched view of the Chicago Skyline, we were also impressed by the helpfulness of the staff. Their knowledge of the city ensured we had a safe and family-friendly weekend. The room was well-appointed with space for this family of 4 to move around and everything was immaculately clean. We were a little disappointed that there was only 1 chair in the room, no table, and we were on the south-side of the city, so walking adventures had to start with a cab-ride (shuttle service is only one way and was booked for our entire stay). Those items were the only reason we did not give this hotel an &quot;excellent&quot; rating.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 18 2008\\tBetter off at a Holiday Inn\\tAdequate, but missing basic amenities. No cups or glasses in the room. Bed sheets too short for the mattress. Room was dirty. None of the lights worked because they had been unplugged. Can't believe they don't have wireless and they charge for Internet!! Even a cheap hotel has free wireless!!Bottom line--it's a place to sleep, but it's not what I expect from a Hyatt Regency.\\t\\n\",\n",

Arrived at 3pm to find floor full of breakfast trays outside 1/3 of the doors on the floor including our room. Our first room was water logged due to some sort heater leak. It was truly like a suana -- not entirely bad in a Chicago winter! Someone must have known because there were towels on the window sills. Manager was unhelpful, wanted to fix the problem rather than assign new room. We were initially told there were no other rooms available, then a few seconds later one &quot;just popped-up.&quot;Second room was a smoking room -- not informed of this. Requested some shampoo and it never arrived.It seems as if they were really short on staff, but you would think they would have a handle on it by now.

       " \"Nov 10 2007 \\tHyatt Regency McCormick Place - pros and cons\\tI just returned from a large conference in Chicago where I stayed at the Hyatt Regency that was attached to the conference center. There were definite pros and cons to staying there. The pros: large clean room with comfortable beds, never had to go outside to attend conference events, speedy elevators, and a nice fitness center. The cons: not close to any downtown attractions or restaurants, hotel restaurants were expensive and food only so-so, ridiculously long lines to get a cab to go anywhere at night, and no free wireless anywhere in the hotel, even the lobby areas. I can't decide if the convenience of being right at the conference events outweighed the other inconvieniences, espcially being able to find something to eat. It required a cab ride to go anywhere for dinner and there was one night I waited 35 minutes in line in the lobby to get a cab to go downtown and another night that I decided it wasn't worth the wait and had a tasteless bowl of soup for $8 in the hotel restaurant. The concierege said the walk to the train downtown wasn't safe at night, so the only choices were cabs or the bus. One night, a group of us braved the bus to go downtown for dinner, which was the most interesting experience I had during the trip! There were some food courts in the actual conference center, but they also seemed to have long lines and food that wasn't very good. So I was frustrated a lot with meals and wished I had packed some crackers or something to get me by. I was also aggravated at paying over $200 a night for a room and still having to pay another $10 for internet service, even in the lobby. I'm not sure I'd stay there again, even for a conference in the dead of winter where I didn't want to go outside to attend conference events. While the room was nice, with a view of the city and lake, it just didn't seem to be worth the cost and hassles.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 10 2007 \\tJust Okay...\\tWith the Hyatt chain one usually expects to pay a little more but get more in the way of amenities and service. Well, I'd say it was a toss up with this hotel.I'm currently staying here as I write this review. My wife is attending a convention and have to admit that being connected to the convention center is VERY convenient. For those that complain about the bad location, the hotel is here mainly to accommodate the traveler that is attending conventions NOT for those that want convenience to downtown. There are the Park and Regency Hyatt's for that.The room is actually quite nice. Double sinks and nice beds. But here's my first gripe, while some may love the beds, for me, they are incredibly too soft! There's a pillow top and I get up in the morning with a back ache. Not sure if they have other types of bed. My wife is sleeping on the ground for the past few days. (I don't think it's because of me! LOL!)Second gripe is that the concierge staff is pretty useless. They're okay for simple things but they are definitely not up to snuff for really complicated things. Third gripe and a major one to me, the shuttle runs once an hour. That's fine, they'll stop at the Museum Campus (GREAT MUSEUMS! Get the City Pass and you're set for several days worth of entertainment!), Navy Pier and WaterTower. But here's the glitch, they don't pick up! What's up with that? How much of a hassle is it to stop on the way out to pick folks up? Geez! Such a small thing that can make the stay here much more pleasant. To me, it's almost illogical to offer the pick up. Oh well...Fourth gripe, the wait help in the restaurant Shor is terrible. We ate at the breakfast buffet for three days and every single day we had to rely on the assistants to serve us. And the only time we'd see the waiter is when the bill came! How's that??? Decided to give the tip directly to the assistant than leave anything with the bill.Here's the good stuff:House cleaning folks are very nice. Bring them a little something from your hometown and they'll great care of you. I think that means more to them than the standard tip (but don't forget that too!)Front desk is fairly efficient and cordial.Rooms are clean and fairly nice.Only costs about $10-$12 to town for a cab.Check out how much you'll be paying for a shuttle, the cab may be cheaper from Midway at least.In conclusion, for the price one pays for this hotel, there may be better deals to be had but if you're coming for a conference, it's kinda hard to beat the convenience of being right here.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 6 2007 \\tGood Business Hotel But Difficult to Get Downtown\\tThe lobby areas are all very nice and the hotel staff is well trained, just like most other Hyatt properties. It seems like the hotel was a conversion from an old Holiday Inn because the ceilings on the guest room floors are low and the hallways look dated. The guest rooms were average and somewhat on the small side. This is very picky, but I didn't like the fact that there was no closet door but instead a curtain over the closet.The bar and restaurants had been remodeled since the last time I had stayed here. The bar is very nice and has a great drink selection.My biggest gripe with the hotel is its location because it is so far away from anything and somewhat difficult to get downtown.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nov 4 2007 \\tNice hotel- not the best location\\tMy husband I stayed here for three nights for a weekend getaway to Chicago. The hotel was very nice. Our room was clean, and updated- with a beautiful view of the city. My only complaint is the location.... we wished we had been closer to the heart of downtown- where the restaurants and shops are.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Sep 27 2007 \\tOk Hotel for business travel\\tI stayed here for 3 nights in September due to a conference in the hotel. My hotel rate was neogtiated for the conference - so I'm not sure how much a regular person would pay. I took a taxi from midway airport for about $25 (it was cheaper than the shuttles) and it took about 20 minutes.The hotel is connected to the conference center which is a nice feature if that is your purpose - if you are a tourist - i wouldn't pick this hotel due to its location. There were no restuarants/shopping/activities near by at all - a taxi or car would be required should you want to do anything.The hotel rooms were a nice size and looked like they had been updated recently. The bed was very comfortable. My view was of the conference center - nothing exciting. Try to get a waterfront room. Internet cost is $9.95 per day - it would be nice to have wireless in the rooms and since the rooms are expensive - it would be nice to have internet included in the price instead of as an extra charge.The walls between the room and hallway are quite thin. Every night I could here other guests go into their rooms. This was especially annoying after the Bears game Sunday night. Guests were quite loud after midnight, which woke me up.I ate in the restaurants twice - the food was good, but typical expensive hotel food. The conference food was fine too. The coffee shop is expensive. A bottle of water costs $3 for 1 pint. Go to the vending machines near your room - $1.50 for 24 oz. - much better deal. I don't know how much coffee was since I don't drink it. Overall, my experience was fine, but if you are a tourist - try to pick something more centrally located.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 25 2007 \\tGreat view\\tWe were at a conference in the adjacent McCormick Place (Which is absolutely huge, so budget time to get from your room to the conference, which maybe be literally 3-4 indoors blocks away)The room we got was on the 31st floor facing north towards downtown. We had Chicago at our doorstep, and the view is really worth it. It is kinda far to walk (a couple miles), but we did actually walk, via Soldier Field waterfront, to downtown and onto the Miracle Mile. The cab back was $10.The room was nice, and the bed comfy. No complaints about the size or furniture. the walls and doors do seem a tad thin so several nights we heard a lot of noise from outside. Wired internet is $10, as is the norm in many a Hyatt or other high end places. (How come the cheap places has free internet???)My main complaint is the public spaces in the lobby are so small, and when you are getting out of a conference with hundreds of other people, the lobby and elevator bay is crowded. The lines for elevators can be real long. The food is very pricey, and eateries minimal. We did room service and enjoyed the food (pricey but not much worse than at a table)They do not have a shuttle to Midway airport, so we had to pay a third party shuttle.If i was going back to Chicago for pleasure i might pick a closer in hotel to downtown, but this was very serviceble.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Sep 2 2007 \\tThe Good the Bad not much Ugly...\\tIn town for conference. First, great facilities for having meetings, well laid out and easy to get to. No complaints there.The Room: You have to pay extra for the City View but it was worth it! Saw the Navy Pier and the fireworks, watched the Bears Game at Soldier Field on the stadium Jumbo-tron, great night views of the skyline.!No frig in room and I cannot believe they charge for Internet access! $10.00 per day! The beds were soft and very comfortable and the rooms are &quot;surface clean&quot; ( just don't drop anything behind the bed YIKES!). Quiet and relaxing otherwise.The Food: Bring Fort Knox reserves with you if you eat here. Very pricey and not so great. My steak was tough and charred on one side and the other menu items I ordered were mediocre at best. The front desk will give the menus of restaurants that deliver and they are worth the $2.85 delivery charge. Guidanno's (sp?) and a Chinese place nearby are very tasty and the delivery was fast. There is a Starbuck's there and a small bag of Chex mix is $4.50.Transportation: The hotel has a shuttle that will take you to the Navy Pier, the Watertower Area and downtown but won't bring you back. Cabs ranged from $10.00 to $15.00. Too far away to walk anywhere. Next time I will stay downtown.Recreation: Went to Shedd Aquarium. Buy your tickets online and avoid the HUGE lines of people w/o tickets. Very nice and well worth the price. So was the Field Musuem. The Navy Pier was fun and be sure to take a spin in the Ferris Wheel. All in all, a good hotel just hindered by its unfortunate location,overpriced, unfortunate food. Great for conferences though.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 26 2007 \\tEasy access to Lake Front !\\tWe booked our 4 night stay here for a conference next door. As it became close to our arrival I was nervous after reading reviews that I would be unhappy. In particular because we were not close to town. What we discovered was much different.The room itself was great. The bed was enormously comfortable and we did not find noise to be a problem (we were on 9th foor). We asked James, one of the concierges where we could run and he gave us excellent directions to the Lake Front. Just down the street to the bridge on 18th street over the tracks and to the lake fron via Soldier's Field. We walked back from down town as well as enjoying several runs. The lake front is beautiful, felt very safe and had lots of &quot;people traffic.&quot; No scary &quot;bad neighborhoods.&quot;The main restaurant needs a major over haul, The people were freindly and service was great but the room was stark, hard and the lights too bright. The bar, on the other hand was very comforatble and well laid out. The prices for all food was very high but there is not a lot of choice yet in the area. We did happen on a Society Bistro a few blocks away that had the BEST coffee and muffins (for less than we paid for 2 coffees at the hotel). Near the museums. We were very happy with our stay - all personnel were friendly &amp; helpful .\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 26 2007 \\tVery nice hotel. Go Bears :)\\tStayed at the Hyatt last night to attend a Bears game and the proximity to Soldier Field is perfect (we walked there). The hotel itself was very nice and exactly what I expected. Our room and bed was comfortable (although they were unable to fulfill our request for a King bed and we ended up with 2 queens). Paid $100 on Hotwire for the room and it was quite nice for what we paid.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 19 2007 \\tNice beds and bathrooms bad location\\tThe hotel was beautiful, the beds were very comfortable, and the double sink was very nice. However, the walls were very thin and we got in trouble for being too loud. The only other bad thing is the location, so far away from where we wanted to go. The free shuttle service only takes you to a few locations, but it doesn't bring you back. And it only goes one time at every hour. Make sure you check your bill. I got charged for movies I didn't watch. I would recommend this hotel for business use but not for vacation with friends.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 8 2007 \\tFine for a convention\\tI stayed at the Hyatt McCormick Place for two nights at a convention in August 2007. Paid $169 a night for the 'business plan' - I don't think it was worth the extra $20 for breakfast at the restaurant. The rooms are standard Hyatt, decent bed and sheets, but nothing fancy. No room safe and $10 a day for high speed internet. $24 a day for parking. The public areas were bright, airy, and clean and seemed to handle our group well. Not so for the one line coffee stand and the one restaurant for breakfast. There are no other options close to McCormick Place, so the food there is the only game in town, unless you want to drive or take a cab elsewhere. The guest floor hall on my floor was dirty and was not cleaned during my stay. All in all, fine for the purpose but I would not go back for any other reason.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jul 25 2007 \\tOk Experience\\tI made the reservations through hotwire, at a rate of $129.00. (I learned later that I could have got it for $ 99 or lower on priceline.com) The rooms are comfortable, nothing fancy. I expected a little more from a Hyatt. I did request a room with a city view; instead my room faced the opposite direction with wonderful view of illinois. The staff informed the city view rooms have an additional fee. I was kind of disappointed about that. The hotel is located few minutes from downtown Chicago. If you plan to take cabs its about $10 each way. The hotel does offer complementary shuttle services every hour but it get filled quickly. I would spend a little more and get a hotel in the loop, youll save the money from your cab rides. You can also take the #3 bus right in front of the hotel. You can buy $5 day passes that you can use for both the buses and trains from the hotel concierge. Great location, if you plan to attend a conference at the McCormick Convention Center.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 24 2007 \\tGreat Hotel - Acceptable location but not great for tourists\\tI booked this hotel through Hotwire just a few days before a last minute trip that I planned with friends. I typically prefer to use Priceline, however I was continually shut out even with what I considered high bids for Chicago. The price that I got the hotel for on Hotwire was a great deal all things considered.The hotel was nice, and the staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms were spacious and clean. I've stayed in hotels in Chiago before where the room was large enough for just the bed and a small path on either side. Our room here was definitely big enough for us.The only staff that I had to talk to after check-in was the house keeping staff. The in-room coffee makers are only for a single cup of coffee and this is all the coffee that is typically provided. Hearing the housekeeping staff in the hallway, I popped my head out and asked if we could have a few extra packets. She said no problem, and gave me a few. When she made up our room after we left, she provided extra packs for the next day as well.As many have noted, this hotel is a bit far south of 'downtown' to be easily walked. The hotel does provide a few shuttle for guests, however the two times that we tried to use it the signup sheet was full. There is the public bus, the #3, that goes directly in front of the hotel and takes you up Michigan Avenue to at least the river and gets you there in about 10 minutes. On our first day in Chicago we purchased CTA transit cards so that we could use the El (train/subway) and these work on the buses as well.\\t\\n\",\n",

The rooms; while not extremely fancy are most comfortable and some of the room views, especially of the lake are gorgeous!The staff is very pleasant, and the service overall was exceptional. The rates are also reasonable for a hotel in Chicago, very close to downtown.Because I am a regular; once for my birthday, I had a card, cake and fruit basket waiting for me at check-in... it made my day!Try this hotel, I guarantee you'll like it!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jul 19 2007 \\tSo-So\\tWe were attending a wedding in the area so we booked this hotel due to a package with free parking. The hotel was ok, but I expected more. Things like strange long hairs in the tub, moldy shower curtains and lipstick on the sheet covers just turn you off and you do not expect them at the Hyatt level. The front end staff also seems to be very confused. The breakfast buffet was $15 and definitely not worth the money even in Chicago. The pool is very small and a big disappointment to the kids. Not sure I would ever stay there again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 11 2007 \\tWould Stay Again\\tJust returned from a 3 night stay with kids. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We got a free upgrade simply by asking. Our view was fantastic with a view of Lake Michigan, the Magnificent Mile, and Navy Pier complete with fireworks seen from our room. It took some searching, but we also got complimentary free parking which was worth a lot over the 3 days... The money saved there was spent on cabs to our destinations. The shuttles run every hour, but space is limited. We used them twice during our stay, and if you want to be assured a seat, it's a good idea to sign up early in the day. We only ate breakfast at the hotel and it is pricey. But it's Chicago and everything is pricey. We would definately consider staying again. I was a little hesitant at first after reading some reviews, but everyone was very kind and seemed to be sincere in making our stay as pleasant as possible. And it was much appreciated!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 8 2007 \\tGood Choice If You Get a Deal on Rates\\tThe rooms are cool and modern, the staff is friendly, the service is efficient and effective. I got the hotel for $109 per night on Hotwire and I feel I got a bit more than my money's worth. I loved the citris and lavender shampoos and soaps.The location is not the best for a tourist, unless you can navigate public transit. Here are my tips for getting to sites from this hotel:* Start off with the Chicago Transit Authority's website at [--]. * In the left margin on the home page is a link to a trip planner section. All you need to do is put in your starting and ending locations and it will map out a route. The trip times were accurate in my case. They also give walking directions to the station and from the station to your final destination with the routes. This was the best preparation I did for my trip.* Buy a CTA Visitor's Pass *I bought a 3 day visitor's pass for $12 at the train station at the O'Hare airport. I booked around town for my whole trip and only took two cabs, so I ended paying only $25 for all my transit for three days. * Get to know the #3 bus.*  It stops just outside the hotel (go out the door and left down King drive half a block) and runs along Michigan Avenue to where Chicago Avenue crosses. Busses come about every ten minutes on weekdays, every twenty on weekends. It is a half hour ride to Chicago where all the fabulous north Michigan Avenue Shopping is, a fifteen minute ride to the Roosevelt Avenue stop where you get off for the Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum or to walk two blocks to the red, orange, or green train lines; and about 17 minutes to get off at Jackson for the Art Institute of Chicago. The bus was pretty full each time I rode, so expect to do some standing.* Avoid the walk from the Hyatt to the Red Line *The walk from the Cermak/Chinatown stop on the red line took me fifteen minutes at a brisk pace. Kind of a long drag with luggage. I walked it once at midnight too and that was a bad choice. Nothing happened, but the route was pretty deserted, save a couple of panhandlers. The next night, I took a cab from the Roosevelt station, the stop right before the Cermak/Chinatown, on the red line ($5) and felt a lot better.* Pick Up a Train Map *The trains were great. The trip from O'Hare to the hotel took an hour and ten minutes of train time, the trip to Midway only twenty five minutes. Other than a twenty minute wait for the orange line train back to midway (my train just pulled out as I was coming up the steps), I never waited more than seven minutes for a train. I was able to get within four blocks of all of my destinations by train. I travelled alone and felt safe using the trains, even late at night.* Use the hotel's shuttle if it's on the hour *Since I had the transit pass, I only used the shuttle once when I just happened to be in the lobby on the hour. You sign in at the guest services desk, the shuttle runs 11:00 am to about 6:00 pm and stops at the museum campus, the Navy Pier, and the Water Tower (all stops on the bus #3 route). It doesn't pick up though, so it didn't do much for me.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 21 2007\\tGreat service cool relaxing vibe.\\tWe got this hotel for $122 a night through Hotwire. It would have been $109 if we had not added a Monday night to the reservation. Service was top notch and exceeded expectations even for a 4 star hotel. The hotel is done in a modern style but everything is warm and relaxing rather than sterile feeling. They have really cool relaxing modern jazz/new age background music in the public areas of the hotel. All of the staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. The desk staff was great. I could not find the concierge but someone from the staff saw me walk away, followed me and was very helpful in figuring out my destination. Others have commented on the location of the hotel. It is very far south of the action but honestly was not that bad of a location. The museums and waterfront are nearby. On the second day we were made aware that you could possibly get through the convention center to get over the train tracks and Lake Shore Drive to get to the lakefront and walk up to the museums. We did not check this for ourselves. There is also a second Starbucks in the convention center. The nearby neighborhood is in the process of being built up with high end townhouses to the north and west. South still looked a bit dicey. There is a coffee shop and convenience store in the lobby. They had a great array of breakfast items to go and Starbucks coffee. They do have espresso drinks and this was a big plus since I don't drink regular brewed and that is usually all you can get at most hotels. We had a room on the 18th floor with a great view of the lake, downtown and navy pier. Rooms are extremely nice but a bit small. The only cons were that the pool is meant more for laps than for kids using it. There is no hot tub either. The rooms could have made better use of the space by making the large closet and bench near the door go away and use some of that space to put chairs or a couch near the window to check out the view. If you have a north view room check out the old gothic building directly next to the hotel to the north. I think it is the old naval observatory building. It has some interesting architecture.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 8 2007 \\tDo consider this hotel in Chicago!\\tSince this hotel is right next to the McCormick Place Convention Center in Chicago, it is the ideal location for attending any meeting at the Center. When all the other delegates have to catch a bus in the monring, you will just walk 50m - luxury!Even if you are not attending a convention, this hotel is in my opinion quite a good choice for Chicago. The next door Convention Center has a Metra station underneath - so train to Chicago's downtown is simple and quick. The hotel itself has good facilities and is only 200m from the lake shore. Taxis into town cost little from here - and compared to some of the downtown Chicago hotels, the McCormick Place Hyatt is modern and well fitted out. I walked around the local area during the day and felt safe, but most of Chicago's attractions (museums, shops, architecture) are a short taxi ride away.\\t\\n\",\n",

Our room faced the lake and had a nice view of Navy Pier, which would have been good in the summer when they have the fireworks.Despite the hotels features, we will never stay here again because it is simply too far south of the restaurants and activities we want and the surrounding neighborhood is a disaster.The self-park garage was attached to the hotel and safe ($24 for 24 hours). The hotel offers breakfast, but most of the dishes are $12+ which is pricey for eggs and toast, even in Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 30 2007 \\twelcome to the'' Projects''\\tWe have just returned from a weekend trip to Chicago and stayed at the Hyatt.In all honesty the hotel is fine .We had a King size city view room and other than the fact there was no fridge there was little to fault it.The problem lies in its location.If you are the type that gets in a taxi to take you and bring you back from places then the location does not matter in the least.A trip to downtown works out a liitle under $10 one way.The hotel website provides distances to the main attractions ---DO NOT BELIEVE THE INFORMATION.Walking to downtown is over 3 miles and you pass an area which is classified ''A PROJECT AREA'' so be on your guard!!!!!There is the No3 bus that stops outside the hotel and that takes you straight to the main downtown area where you can change buses for other destinations. If you are like us- after you have done the sightseeing bit and all you want to do is shower and go out for drinks and a bite to eat then this hotel won't be for you.You would be better off downtown and we regretted not choosing one in or near the magnificent mile.As a final note a cab to O'hare cost $43\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Apr 23 2007 \\tGreat Hotel!\\tI booked this hotel through priceline.com, $130 a night for a room with two double beds. We were on the 31st floor with a great view of the lake and the city! We arrived by train around 9am on our check-in day, and were allowed to check in right away! The room was very clean, modern, and spacious. The window in the room was huge! The pool area was very nice, and when we swam, we were the only people in the pool area! The hotel has a lounge (M/X Lounge) which is a martini bar that serves some food also. The martinis were $10-$12 each, but they were very good - although, the &quot;Lava Lamp&quot; martini tasted a bit like cough syrup (just because of the ingredients, obviously, no fault of the bartender). The lounge seemed to be a bit under-staffed for a Saturday night, 2 servers working the entire room, so the wait time was long. Overall, the service was great, except the Guest Services desk seemed to be a little confused about their Shuttle (I was told by one person that it ran to the Science and Industry museum, and then told by another that it did not), If you get a great deal on the room this is a wonderful hotel to stay at, but if you pay full price, and expect to go downtown quite a bit, expect a $11-$15 cab ride each way. Overall, a very nice hotel, but a little out of the way if you plan to go downtown quite a bit.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Mar 15 2007\\tGreat hotel if not a little expensive\\tWhen arrived the bell boy was polite and took our bags, the valet drove our car away, he was also very friendly and professional. The hotel is large, modern, and spotless. The elevators were clean and very fast. We stayed on the 30th floor and had a great view, our room was pretty clean and well equipped. The air conditioner was quiet if not under powered. The restaurant listed on the website had been remodeled into 2 new ones. One of them had very weird combinations of food for low prices and the other had chicken breast for $15 in a really nice and modern atmosphere. We chose the second one and were surprised at how well the service was. Next to the expensive restaurant [shor or something like that] there was a large sitting area and 2 escalators that were very intimidating and fast. A bit loud and distracting the escalators were yet again, spotless. Throughout the hotel was this new age ish music playing....its cool for a while but can get annoying. The exercise center has top of the line equipment and complimentary water...the pool is smallish and warm. Overall the hotel was really nice and empty when I was there and the staff would be very nice...depending on how nice the tip was.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Mar 2 2007\\tNice hotel\\tWe stayed at the Hyatt McCormick place for a trade show feb. 22-25 , 2007We were there early and were checked in by 9 am, the staff that helped us put us on the 31st floor facing the city, we had a comanding view of the Chicago Skyline , Navy Pier, Soldier Field, Shedd aquarium and the planitaraium. We were given vouchers for full breakfast at the in house restaurant &quot;shore&quot; which was excellent food with the endless glass of fresh squeezed OJ.....the restaurant is pricey so breakfast for two was at least 25.00 a day......Also ate at the adacent food place and food was casual but excellent, dinner at shore was excellent also....Room was typical for this type of hotel as far a size goes....small bathroom, separate sink area and nice linens on the beds...best part was the view.....IT was cold so we didn't go out to dinner while there and there were only two places to order take out that would deliver to the hotel , one chinese (passable but not great) and one pizza ( stuffed pizza was great.)....but other than than not many dining options on a cold snowy night unless you head to town in a 10 to 15 minute ride. The train runs through the McCormick Place and you could catch it into town also.....All in all the stay was good , staff was very helpfull and food at hotel was excellent,.It is connected to the convention center so we didn't have to go outside during the show days.....being from Hawaii and Feb. in Chicago.........that was a definate plus!\\t\\n\",\n",

(upon speaking to the front desk clerk, we were assured they were going to be delivered, 2 hrs later and checkout time... NADA)Third, we never received our breakfast vouchers as advertised and when we went to the front desk, at first I was told we were not elligble? After speaking with the clerk further, we were issued the voucher however had all of 20 minutes left to get to the restaurant and eat as she said it was closing @ 10:30? And last but not least... the $24 a day parking was rather steep...All in all the room was ok, the curtain rod closet was rather cheap looking, and the bed was so so. (For a king bed it seemed small.) The restaurant was stuffy and pretentious, not to mention very expensive. (FYI: the restaurants on their website do not exist anymore, they have been replaced by a snobby, cold eurochic restaurant called &quot;Shor&quot;. The martini bar is non existant.All in all I don't think I would EVER go back to this particular location.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dec 8 2006 \\tNice business trip hotel\\tStayed at the Hyatt for a 3 day business trip. It is centrally located and is in close proximity to the lake. The fitness center was really nice but they wanted $20 to do a swim workout in the pool next door. The rooms are very nice and if you ask, they will give you one with a view. The food inthe lobby restaurants and bars are decent and reasonably priced for a city hotel. I will definitely stay here again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Dec 5 2006 \\tOk for a business trip\\tThis is not a tourist hotel. The Hyatt McCormack is off the beaten path and you cannot walk to any shops or restaurants from the. I was staying at the Hyatt for a 3-day convention which the hotel was suited perfectly for. Rooms were clean, service was good and the beds were comfortable. The reception offered automatic rooim key card kiosks for check-in which was really convenient. The health club is mediocre, not nearly as nice as other properties. The lounge/bar area is adequate with TVs for sports and basic pub food. Chicago is a wonderful destination - I would just recommend a more convenient location if you are going for a fun filled visit.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Oct 26 2006 \\tmixed bag\\tDefinitely a nice hotel with well appointed rooms, but unfortunately a few negatives. Stayed there for the Chicago Marathon and the location, as many others have noted, is not ideal for visiting downtown although great for events at McCormick Place or Soldiers Field. Our room was large and comfortable. We were disappointed to find there was no hot tub although the lap pool was nice. The locker room for the pool and fitness center had only one shower which was less than adequate for a huge hotel filled to capacity with runners. Front desk personnel were all nice and helpful, and the concierge was great at securing dinner reservations and providing bus and train info. Loved the kiosk in the lobby where you could print your airline boarding pass and check on the weather where you were going. The biggest drawback was the housekeeping staff. We had been out of our room since 6:30 am for the race and did not return until nearly 2 pm. The room had not yet been made up. We were exhausted and laid down for a nap after putting out the privacy notice. Shortly after the phone rang with housekeeping wanting to get in and clean the room. I did not appreciate being roused from sleep and ousted from my room. I did complain later, and the customer service rep was most apologetic and promised to notify the manager of this.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 11 2006\\tWhat a relaxing weekend\\tI am a travel agent and I just recently got a chance to get away on my own mini vacation; as they are very far and few in between. I stayed at the Hyatt McCormick. I picked this location because I wanted to make sure to avoid the hustle and bustle everyday during my stay. I wanted to be close to the action but not right in the middle of it. This was the perfect place. When I got there it was right off the highway so you couldn't miss it. The lobby was very nice. It has great neutrals and plush carpets and high polished decor. The staff was very courteous and very efficient. If there was a wait, they made sure to let you know that this was not a common occurrence. I stayed on a weekend so I expected a crowd at this convention hotel but was pleasantly surprised. Anyway, I had requested a room on a high floor (since I planned to spend most of my time sightseeing from my room) and was given a very nice room on the 30th floor. The rooms are clean (and I'm very, very particular about where I sleep). I love the way the room has the divider wall that separates the 2 sink vanity from the rest of the room. The beds and linens are plush and the room is very relaxing yet will accommodate the business traveler without a problem. To my surprise the bathroom was great! Normally you may see water stains or mildew or other signs of half cleaning but I didn't see any of that at this hotel. Breakfast was great as well. I ordered off the menu but my companion went to the buffet and got just as much as I did and probably even a better selection. The grounds were well manicured and there was always someone cleaning. (That's very big for me) I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 2 2006 \\tIf Your company isn't paying Don't Stay\\tStayed in the hotel for 3 nights. Arrived after Flight From JFK. Made reservation via there 1-800. Long line at reception, so used the self-check-in. was given room with an open plan bathroom, which looks cheap and tacky. Went back to reception, and got a room change. Next room was better, but had an adjoining door to a suite that had a conference taking place. Went back to reception (Again!) and got moved to a room which was like the first, with the open bathroom, but was quiet, so we put up with it. The Business center there has to win a prize for the most expensive ever. They Charge $1 a minute to use the computers, and to print a page $5 a page. If you want Color print, it's $8.When the reservation was made, I paid $20 a night extra, for 2 people, to have breakfast included. On getting to the hotel, I was given some coupons for Continental breakfast, which were Cereal and A piece of bread and tomato...Not good and not worth the $20. Yet, if you want to change to a hot breakfast, Forget the $20 value, the coupons will be worth $12 - $6 each. The hotel offers a Bus to take you into town, yet only takes you; youre on your own to get back.The Rate I was given was including tax, But on Checkout, they made me pay tax on top of the room rate. Not good service.Won't stay again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 17 2006 \\tHotel okay...Service Nay\\tFor $300 a night I was expecting a little more. The hotel itself was alright enough however the service was less than it should have been. For example, room services stops at midnight and there is nothing within walking distance. Also, I had to call down for towels every day often it would take an hour or more, and additional calls for them to arrive. Also one day that i was there I came to the room about 4 p.m. to find housekeeping in my room watching T.V,. which I had turned off before leaving. She then had the nerve to act annoyed that we were in the room and very rudely asked us to move so that she could vacuum. Also, breakfast on one day took almost an hour to arrive at our table. The accomodations were clean however and the furniture was in good shape. No fitted sheets on the beds though.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 28 2006 \\tAlmost perfect!\\tWe stayed Hyatt Regency McCormick Place for two nights and didn't have any issues. The room was nice, the lobby was nice, the staff was helpful. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, was the bathroom: the counter was small which left little room for personal stuff, and there wasn't a vent so the room got quite steamy and humid when taking showers. But, of course, that didn't ruin the stay at all!As others have said, it is not downtown or really within walking distance of much. However, the #3 CTA Bus will take you right down Michigan and the Metra will take you the other way. We took a cab home from Rush St one night and it only cost $12. We had no problem getting anywhere! Overall I recommend the Hyatt McCormick.\\t\\n\",\n",

No it is not downtown so don't stay here if you want to be in the Loop. This hotel is within in walking distance of Soldier's Field, the Field Museum, the Shedd Aquarium and the Adler Planetarium. The hotel itself is clean, the rooms are in good shape, the staff was friendly and the food in the Networks restaurant was good at breakfast on the Sunday we ate there.I would stay there again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 21 2006 \\tWould not intentionally stay here.\\tSeveral coworkers and myself were attending a conference at the McCormick Center and put up at the hotel by our agency.Upon entering the lobby it appears to be a beautiful hotel and checked in with an ease. I entered my room my smell senses were overpowered with some sort of carpet fresh fragrance. (I am sensitive to smells more so than most,)I called down to the lobby and they readily agreed to put me in a different room. The first room was on the 18th floor with a beautiful view. The second room was on the 21st floor with also great view. The second room smelled worse than the first. It had an overpowering smell of cigarette smoke as if the room next door was smoking and we were sharing the same air vent. It was not a nonsmoking floor.This time I went down to the lobby. (The staff was always extremely helpful during my stay. They never once acted agitated towards me.) Explained to the desk clerk and he said that he would put me in a room on the 8th floor as the floor had been recently remodeled. It worked, as the smells were neutral. :( Lost my view but I was happy!)Before I had left home I had read the reviews on this site. Once I had settled in the room I could see why the hotel received such poor reviews.My list. Mold in the shower and no fan in the bathroom, clumps of hair on the hair dryer, tooth paste looking salvia in the bottom of the water glass, (check those room glass it looks like they sometimes recycle them without washing them.), dusty, scuff marks on walls, opened window and cigarette ashes flew in the room, no safe, paper cups for the coffee, phones were old and dirty, in the last two rooms the carpet was ripped and had snags to trip over.But I was still happy with the room. I did phone the manager of house keeping and he came up to the room. I informed him of this site and pointed out the things mentioned above, as they are almost all fixable.He offered a bottle of wine and chocolates and I accepted.The next morning I got up and put the dirty glasses including the one with white stuff on the bottom on the edge of the counter to show they had been used. I came back to the room in the afternoon and to my surprise the maid had turned the glasses upside down and placed them back to be used again. There sat that toothpaste salvia glass. I called two maids into the room and the maid who had clean the room tried pulling the glass out of my had. Told her I wanted to keep it. Called the manager and left a phone message about the glass.Went for an hour conference in the afternoon and came back to the room. The maids had been in for the second time and had doused the bathroom with bleach. The whole room was overpowered with bleach smell and the glass was gone. I then asked to speak to the hotel manager and to be switched again because of the smell.The next room smelled fine and was about in the same shape as the last one. The fiscal was over. Had dinner one night at the restaurant and the food was good would recommend the lobster bisque. Ate at the breakfast buffet and this was mediocre. Fresh coffee and orange juice but you pay $4.00 and $5.00 a glass or cup.The location of the hotel is poor however; public transportation and the hotel provide economical means to get downtown. Not everyone is comfortable taking the bus though. We did use public transportation and it was user friendly but took a cab one late evening for a cost of about $12.00 plus tip. It is a $45.00 cab ride to the airport.Again the staff was all great. The conference center was excellent and user friendly.On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate it a 5. I would stay there again if I were going to a conference but not for any other reason. It is not a good value for your money.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Apr 9 2006 \\tBetter than expected\\tLet me first say that I was not looking forward to staying at this hotel. Initially I wanted a place closer to downtown, but since my conference was at McCormick place I had little choice. Second, I generally despise conference hotels since thay are impersonal and just too big for the personal touches and attention. What a suprise to find that the Hyatt at McCormick place defied my expectations. First and foremost, the service was great. The staff, to a person, was pleasant, helpful and often went beyond the call of duty. I was able to get an upgrade to a suite and a late check-out for example. By the way, the suite which was on the 22nd floor was wonderful and had a phenomenal view of Lake Michigan and downtown. The only downside, as may people have commented in their reviews, is that the hotel is out of the way, and you end up paying a small fortune in cab fares to get around town. That being said, if you are on conference at McCormick place, this is the place to be.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Apr 4 2006\\tOk hotel not the best location.\\tWe only stayed one night in December, so not too much to go on here. The hotel itself is nice. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The hotel staff was pleasant enough. There are two major factors however that will preclude me from ever staying at this hotel again. 1. While the hotel is perfect if you are planning on going to Soldier Field (which is why we stayed there) or to the Convention Center and not planning on going anywhere else, it's not very close to much of the action. You have to take a cab ride to get to any of the areas where there are things to do. It's about a $10 cab ride one way just to get to the Magnificent Mile (which is really the closest area). For the price and location, I would stay around/on the Magnificent Mile itself. 2. The restaurant in the hotel is a rip-off. We had breakfast there, ate the buffet, and the service and food was absolutely horrible. They never came to refill our coffee. The food was cold, almost inedible, and they had no selection. After we asked for our check, it took almost 15 minutes for our server to bring it to us. And all of this cost us over $40 for two people. We could have had a really luxurious breakfast elsewhere for that price. Horrible.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 25 2006\\tNOT impressed!!!!!\\tMy husband and I are currently staying at the McCormick Hyatt for a conference. I am quite unhappy with this hotel and am VERY surprised it is a Hyatt! The pros would be that it is attached to the McCormick Convention Center which is obviously convenient for anyone attending a conference. Also, it was reasonably priced. The cons are as follows: - inconvenient location for anything other than the convention center. NOTHING is nearby. NO restaurants, shops, etc. You must taxi everywhere. During our three day stay here we will spend around $200 for taxi service just to get to the heart of the city's activities. - after returning to check-in to our requested room, which was not available when we first arrived,the bell hop did not offer to take our bags to our room. In fact he scoffed at the request and stated, &quot;Sure, but it's gonna be a long time&quot;. Surprising, as we thought that delivering bags to rooms is the job description of a bell hop. -rooms are average. We were on the 10th floor which would have had good views of the city, but the windows are extremely, extremely dirty so it was difficult to see much of anything through them. Small bathrooms. Several large, unsightly stains on the carpet in the hallways. Missing closet doors in the room. -no concierge available in the morning for helpful restaurant advice, and the gentlemen at the front desk was unhelpful and stated, &quot;There isn't someone at the concierge desk?&quot;I would not stay at the hotel again or recommend this hotel. It does not live up to the Hyatt name! -\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Feb 10 2006 \\tGreat Experience at a Convention Center Hotel\\tFantastic staff, wonderful service, great view of downtown, Lake Michigan and Soldier Field! As an exhibitor at a medical show in January, I had a Regency Suite for my 6-day stay. The suite was spacious and clean, although the furniture in the living/dining area was a little dated and worn.However, the bedroom was a nice size, comfortable betting and nice bathrooms. The staff was courteous and very helpful for my entire stay. Our company had a lot going on in the suite, which served as a meeting room and hospitality area as well, and the food was good and delivered timely. I was able to check in early and when checking out, the complex billing (split between two credit cards) was handled with ease.A special thanks to Jimmy in the package area, who went beyond the call of duty to retrieve a mis-shipped package. I ended up with over 15 packaged shipped to my attention at the hotel, and Jimmy was incredibly helpful in alerting me and allowing me to keep some of the boxes in the holding area.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jan 21 2006\\tDisappointed and Cheated\\tthis would not have been a bad experience if this were a very inexpensive hotel, and if i did not have expectations based on other Hyatt hotels, but considering the price and the Hyatt reputation, I have to say, this was the worst hotel experience i have had in many years. i am actually going to stick with Westin from now on, for consistency alone, let alone quality and service.the service at the Hyatt was rude and unprofessional (barely literate, lazy high-school types), we got two cheap twin beds pushed together (we'd booked a confirmed King, full rate), the beds were uncomfortable and hard and very worn, the hotel (attached to the McCormick convention centre, where our conference of 30,000 was) had no clue where we should go for info about our conference. to top it all off, we'd asked to switch rooms to a king, and were told we could not, then or later. 4 hrs later, my friend checks in, gets a king bed with deluxe fittings, and she'd paid lesser rate and booked months after. NOT a good way to treat customers.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 20 2006\\tBetter than Expected\\tMy wife and I stayed at the Hyatt for an extended 1/14/06-1/17/06 weekend. The big negative for us was the club scene in the lobby on Saturday night. The scene was loud, chaotic and smokey. However, we expected that from researching previous posts on this site and there were many positives with the rest of the hotel. During check-in we had about a dozen couples ahead of us in line. This must happen often because there were at least six staff members at a long check-in counter assisting people. One staff member did nothing but direct the next person in line to the first available check-in staff memeber. We waited in line no more than 5-10 minutes. We were directed to check-in at the assistant manager's counter which is just to the left of the main check-in counter next to the concierge. I don't know if that made a difference in the room that was offered to us, but it may be worth requesting when you arrive. We asked for a quiet room in the west tower preferably with a view of the river. She said that would be a $15 upgrade charge. We said fine since we were able make our reservation using a $79/night promotion that was posted on the Forum section of this web site. She said that room was not available yet but there was a Jr. suite available on the 32nd floor of the east tower that we could have at no additional charge. It turned out to be a double room with wet bar and refrigerator. A very good deal for $79/night. We did not eat at the restaurant but found the lounges to be worthy of a drink before heading out on the town.Except for the club, it was an excellent experience. Just ask to be as far away as possible and you will be fine.\\t\\n\",\n",

This hotel is right off the interstate, easy to find, and in a great location. We had a great time, great service, and good food. The food was a little expensive, but it's Chicago. We had a blast.

       " \"Dec 12 2005\\tNot impressed\\tI stayed in this hotel for one night due to a business meeting in this hotel. I figured that based on the name it would be a decent hotel. The staff at the front desk was great, and the guy helping me supposedly gave me a nicer room when I told him about the terrible taxi ride I'd just had. When I got off the elevator on my floor, the hallway was dirty with bottle caps and misc debris. The room I was about to enter had a 1/2 full glass of soda or something sitting outside of it which made me wonder if the maid had even cleaned the room. There happened to be a maid just down the hall and I asked her to please take the glass away. When I entered the room I immediately noticed the bedspread was messy and I could tell someone had sat down on the bed, probably to watch tv (while they were drinking the glass of whatever was outside the door). So I went back downstairs to the front desk and told the same guy what had happened. He felt really bad and upgraded me to an even nicer room, supposedly. That room was okay but the bathroom was very dated with a plastic, cheap trash can that I wouldn't even put in my own house. I guess I just expected nicer amenaties from such an expensive hotel. I will not stay at this hotel again given the choice.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 15 2005 \\tA nice stay in a Convention Centre Hotel\\tI stayed in the Hyatt with my husband for 3 nights last week. I was attending a Conference in the Hotel. We found the staff to be very efficient, friendly and polite.The room was clean and modern and we had a great view of the lake from our 30th floor room.We ate in the hotel 2 nights. The first night my main course was cold so they took it back and when it re-appeared it was still cold so I just abandoned it at that stage. Our waiter was very nice about it although it was a bit disappointing. The following night we ate in the bar and as a vegetarian they facilitated me with a lunch time dish of 'lentil chilli' - highly recommended. Ray the waiter was also really pleasant &amp; efficient.There was a little shop in the foyer that sold Starbucks coffee (a great treat for those of us from overseas) and their Danishes/pastries/Bagels were really fresh and delicious.My husband used the shuttle service into town to do his sightseeing and the found the driver to be really pleasant.We took a taxi into town one night for dinner and it worked out at about 10dollars each way, which was fine.We paid c.150dollars a night for the hotel and while this sounds more expensive than a lot of the deals other guests obtained, I felt it was a good price for the standard of the hotel. The hotel was also ideal for attending the Conference in the Convention centre and I would happily recommend this hotel if you are attending a Convention in McCormick Place.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 5 2005\\tNice hotel great deal\\tI booked 2 rooms on the &quot;Game Day Special&quot; for 99/night. Yes, as other reviews stated, it was a little out of the way. Walking anywhere, other than the Lake through the hotel, was not an option. However, the free shuttle takes you up and down Michigan Ave and to Navy Pier. That, combined with the free trolley service, got us to Navy Pier, then from there to Sears Tower for free. We also cut down our cab ride to dinner that night by taking the shuttle to the water tower then a cab from there, which was 5 bucks. Of course, the service is only one way. But, we were hardly ever more than a $10 cab ride home, so overall, the location was fine. No matter where we would've stayed wouldn't have been next to EVERY place we wanted to go, so cabbing it was necessary no matter what.In terms of the rooms, they were really nice. Not the best I've ever stayed at, but the bed was GREAT. Pillowtop, with down comforter and pillows. The rooms were decorated modern and I really didn't have any complaints. The rest of the hotel was nice as well. The only negative thing I will say about it was the prices of drinks and breakfast. Drinks were 9 bucks each and the breakfast buffet was 16 or so and absolutely horrid. It had sub-par variety, but what they did have was so bad I couldn't handle paying that much. A breakfast at a gas station would've been better. I complained, and got one breakfast taken off, which in the end, was OK.All in all, this was a nice hotel for the price. Its close enough to be within a $10 cab ride home, the rooms were nice, and the price was right. I'll stay there again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 28 2005\\tgood food and service except for maid scary spiders\\tThis hotel is OK for business customers who need to be at the Convention Center next door, but not for pleasure or children. We were on the 28th floor with a great view of the White Sox field and saw a good fireworks display both nights that they won. The problem with the view was that there were a half dozen big live spiders hanging out in front of the window, which was odd given that we were on the 28th floor! Of course, I was not about to open the window. You can open the windows, although there is a sign not to open the window. But I would not like to have any children with me who just might actually open it. The service was good except for maid service. We started out with 3 towels, 3 wash cloths and a bath mat. The next day we had 3 towels, 2 wash cloths and a bath mat. The last day we had 3 towels, 2 wash cloths and no bath mat. The other thing is that the bottom sheet is not fitted and kept coming off the bed. It was only tucked in at the top and sides and left about 2 feet of the bottom uncovered. So your feet were on the mattress pad or on the mattress itself. Very weird. There is a shuttle to downtown but the windows are painted over so you can barely see where you are going, and the shock absorbers are non existent so the ride is very jarring. Also, the shuttle will drop you off but not pick you back up, so you need to find your own way back to the hotel. Cabs in Chicago are easier to find than any city I have ever been in; so take cabs. Make sure you specify the Hyatt Regency &quot;at McCormick Place&quot; to the cab driver or you may end up at the wrong Hyatt.The restaurant was too cold for my 83 year old mother, so we usually had room service. The food was very good. There is smoking in the lounge which is only separated by the dining room by a partial wall. If you do not like smoke while eating, ask for a table away from the lounge.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 22 2005\\tNice hotel not the best location\\tWe stayed at this Hyatt last week for one night. Pros - Close to Midway Airport, friendly and helpful staff, nice room with great view of Chicago, didn't have to pay for parking which was big considering 99% of the hotels we checked out did charge quite a bit, decent price.Cons - although the room was really clean, I was not all happy to see spots on the comforter. Location - several miles south of where the action is but they do offer a complimentary shuttle (one way only) to get there. All in all, fine for what we needed.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 7 2005\\tGreat Value\\tBooked this hotel through priceline (roughly $76 with all the taxes) this was way cheaper than booking off the hotel site. It is an upscale hotel that would be best for convention goers (located right next to McCormick Place.) But this was also very close for us as we were attending an event at Solidier Field and going to Shedd Aquarium.The hotel was very clean and the service was very good, the only complaint that we had was it was hard to reach the vallet via the phone in the room, but when you went downstairs they were very prompt. The room also had a good view of the city skyline and you could see the lake.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 1 2005\\tJust a tad too far\\tIf only...if only the Hyatt was just closer to the downtown action...if only the front desk staff were as forthcoming with information on transportation, places to eat, or shortcuts to the lake as the janitorial staff...if only the shuttle started running a bit earlier and ran a bit longer...if only the pool was a real pool..the Hyatt would get a much higher rating. As they say, it's all in the details. Check-in was fast and simple, the room was comfortable, although the products used for cleaning left a hospital-like smell. I was a bit put off by the fact that our room only had 3 towels, despite the reservation being for four. I did appreciate the water conservation program in effect. The gym was a big plus and the walk to the lake front through the convention center was perfect for a solo walker venturing out before 6am. Room service was actually better than expected but the hotel cafe is not worth a visit. As whole my experience was okay, but if you have kids or if you want to be around the heart of Chicago this place is not for you. We got the room for less than $85. I wouldn't pay more for it than that...don't forget to add the $24 to $30 for daily parking.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 31 2005\\tBeautiful view great service\\tWe stayed at this hotel, and we were very pleased with our visit. Our room was very clean, and everyone at the hotel was incredibly helpful and nice. The food in the restaurant was excellent. We had an amazing view from the 31st floor that overlooked both the city skyline and the lake. While the hotel is a little away from the sights downtown or by the lake, the lower price we paid for our room ($110) compared to a downtown hotel made up for this inconvenience. And since the hotel is attached to the convention center, you can walk across the pedestrian bridge and easily get to Lakeshore Drive. We ended up walking back from the aquarium to the hotel which was just a couple of miles, and on a nice day, isn't a bad walk. We will definitely stay at this hotel again.The only drawback is the price of parking, but we think the price of parking around any part of Chicago is outrageous! We paid $24 to park in the hotel garage and then took a cab or walked to the places we visited.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 25 2005\\tTerrible service!\\tThe day we checked in to the hotel we waited in line and then walked up to the counter and stood there while the check in attendant was doing something with his computer. Then without looking up he grabs my credit card and types in my name into the computer. He hands me my room key and that was that. He never acknowledged us!When we walked in to our room we got situated and unpacked our suitcases and got a chance to relax.We rang down to housekeeping for additional towels and robes. The robes came with out any belts.There was no light bulb in the desk lamp.One of the bedside lamps was unplugged and we had to try to move the bed to get it plugged in.There was fresh bottled water on top of the TV console with no note on it stating there is a charge for it so we thought it was complementary and opened it up. The next anew bottle was placed in our room with a note on it. We spoke to the bell desk about the shuttle to the airport and we were told that the shuttle ran every  hour and was free. He specifically stated that we didnt need a reservation. When we got down to the lobby to check out and jump on the shuttle there was major confusion.The driver of the shuttle was trying to squeeze 10 elderly over sized adults into his van and was telling us that he had a group that made reservations.We had to get off that bus and take the next one. Our stay at the McCormick Place was a disappointment! We spoke to others on the shuttle bus drive to the airport and they had a terrible experience as well. I would not recommend this Hotel for any of our corporate meetings. The service was terrible! Outside of physically connected to the growing convention center the facility has nothing to offer. Access to any of the areas' attractions is cumbersome at best and could be dangerous for those that did not know the area at all.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 9 2005\\tNot too shabby\\tI stayed at the Hyatt over Memorial Weekend. The hotel was beautiful!! Check-in was pretty quick despite the large number of people checking in. The house keeping service was exceptional. I lost my purse within the first 15 minutes of being there. Of course I was frantic!! The housekeeping staff returned my purse...with everything in it. I was totally grateful to them. I thought the place was awesome. My only complaint is the location. It is not within walking distance of much. You have to take a shuttle, city bus, or taxi to get to the attractions. A bonus is that it is within walking distance of the lakefront which is gorgeous. It is close to the stadium and planetarium, but you have to do a little walking. I liked the hotel, but I would not stay there again simply because I like a hotel that is in the midst of everything. I love the hotel!! It is gorgeous and you couldn't ask for a better place. I highly recommend it to everyone except for the issue with location. Also parking is $24 for up to 24 hours and valet parking is $25. The city bus is 0.75-1.50, I can't quite remember.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jun 7 2005\\tFar away from the action but comfortable\\tWe stayed here for a visit after getting the reservation through Priceline. Although you are south of the attractions , this hotel is doable with the bus stop #3 that stops right in front of the hotel. Just takes a while to get to the loop- 15 min drive and time to wait for the bus.The hotel has a shuttle on the hour but doesnt leave until 11 am. We were long gone by then. Drop off only service to navy pier and loop. The hotel was comfortable beds, spacious rooms and nice restaurant, great shower starbucks right in the hotel. Clean and new. There was some noise in the hall but security came right up and we didnt hear another thing the whole night.There are no metro stops within walking distance (the closest one is through a seedy questionable area)\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Feb 14 2005\\tJust what we were looking for\\tI'm not sure why so many people have issues with this property. We stayed two nights during a show at the convention center next door (very convenient) and we found this hotel to be just fine. Check in was easy and friendly. Bags arrived at room promptly. Valet service for car was fast every time we needed it. Room was nice (we had a corner) and had all the usual amenities. A family we traveled with got stuck in the elevator, and when they returned to their room that night they found wine, muffins, and an apology note. We were initially put in a room near an elevator--the next morning when I checked to see if we could switch to a different room, the response was yes and that was that. Very easy. Are the walls thin? Maybe, but that's often the case. Is the restaurant overpriced? Yes. Is the coffee shop overpriced? Yes. But that's typical of a big city hotel. No, there's not much around the property. It wouldn't be my first choice if I'm visiting the city to walk Michigan Avenue. But for an event at the convention center, it's just fine. \\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Feb 4 2005\\tWorks for Me!\\tIn a very recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Mccormick place I found the hotel to be very bright and full of natural light. Our room was found to be nearly perfect and the staff all around the hotel actually smiled...something I am not used to very often. Location is about ten minutes from the hot spots downtown and perfect for our show at the convention center. All around the hotel...I was pleased with our choice and would make this hotel first on my list anytime traveling to downtown chicago. Thanks Hyatt !\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jan 14 2005\\tStayed here before - but disappointed this time\\tI've stayed at this property before and had good comments. I can't say the same this time around. While the food and service are always very good, the housekeeping left much to be desired. I stayed a total of 8 days and had my sheets changed once. Yes, I complained mid-week. Nothing was done. Additionally, I was given one bar of soap to use between the bath and the sink for the entire week. This is not acceptable from a Hyatt. However, I must note that the staff in the Networks restaurant is outstanding. The host is very friendly and the wait staff did an excellent job. They are a 5-star group. Location is king for this property since it is connected to the McCormick Place. I would probably stay here again for this reason, but I will make sure that housekeeping does a better job next time around.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dec 30 2004\\tA pleasent stay!\\tAfter reading the reviews of the hotel I was very hesitaint about staying here. My son had a two day volleyball tournment at McCormick Place ( the hotel is attached to the convention center) and it just made sense to stay at the hotel. I was told that a special rate was available for the tournment but when I made the reservation thru Haytt I was not able to get it. I had to reserve the room at a AAA rate that was not bad.When we arrived I was pleasently suprised by the hotel. It had a nice lobby and the staff was very friendly and informend me that I received with my AAA rate a $15.00 day credit that could be used for meals. Our room was quite large and CLEAN and had one of the best views of the city that I have seen. We were on the 25th floor looking north up Michigan Ave. The bathroom was good size and the beds were not uncomfortable.I was actualy looking for something wrong and the only thing I could find was the light on the desk did not work.Waking up the next morning it was nice to be able to walk to the tournment without leaving the building.At the tournment I found out from some of the other people staying at the hotel that the special rate was available and I should have been able to get the rate when I booked the room. I was on my way to the front desk expecting a hard time. When I informend them of the situation they were very nice, apologized and made the changes to the rate. It was about $40.00 per night in savings.The second day of the tournment had the chance of running late. I asked if it was possible to get a late check out. Again it was no problem and extended my ckeck out time with a smile.I must say my stay was very nice.I do agree that the hotel is not very convient to the city. It is not walkable to restaurants or any of the citys attractions. You have to take a cab (about $10.00 downtown) or use your own car. The hotel was designed for the convention center and it seems to serve that purpose well.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Dec 10 2004\\tthis is a Hyatt??\\tOur company booked rooms for us while we worked at the convention.It took four tries to get me a room. First they &quot;lost&quot; my reservation, then I was sent to a parlor room, then to a smoked in, non smoking room, then on to a room next to a suite that was full of convention types, then finally to a quiet room in a corner of the hotel. The front desk staff tried to make up for it and sent up a complimentary cheese and fruit spread. The cheese and fruit were dried and stale. Nice try.The elevators? What a joke, we waited forever in line to get into the elevators. This hotel is a pit. Avoid it at all costs. The front desk staff is weak.The best thing about this hotel - the bellman and the concierge.I was also billed for $83.00 in additional costs after my checkoutand they cannot produce a receipt.Stay the the Palmer House.\\t\\n',\n",

Furniture is old and well worn. The bed didn't have a mattress pad and the comforter had visible stains. I will never stay at this hotel again.\\t\\n\",\n",

This hotel had updated rooms, very comfy beds, reasonable sized bathrooms and very good service. I am sensitive to odors, like Febreze covering up bad smells. Hilton Garden Inn smelled fresh and clean and had comfortable rooms. You can hear ambulance/police car sounds at night, which is typical of all Chicago area hoteld. Staff seemed friendly. I felt safe, and Weber Grill reataurant on site is a great place to eat. No probablem getting a cab in the morning when it was raining. I would recommend and stay again. Most downtown hotels have smaller rooms (especially in older hotels). This location is very good for visitors. Tons of places to eat within walking distance.\\t\\n',\n",

(See my review for Residence Inn) We arrived early as our flight landed at Midway at 7:55am and I had already called about an early check in. When we arrived they indicated that they were at 90% capacity. They did not have a non-smoking king room sbut had two queen non-smoking available for the same rate, so we took it! The room was nothing to write home about. The bed was not comfortable at all but the pillows were nice. The remote was old and barely worked most of the time which annoyed me to no end. Breakfast was not complimentary and just to get pastries and yogurt it was $10.95. If you wanted meant that was going to cost you an additional $4.95. I called one of the restaurants in the book from the hotel and ordered myself breakfast which came up to $19.22. They informed me that the menu has not been updated and the meal that was priced at $8.25 was now $10.50. I decided to cancel my order.\\t\\n',\n",

Our beds were so uncomfortable that my husband and I didn't sleep all night and got up with sore backs and necks. The tub in the bathroom wouldn't drain. I ended up not taking a shower in the morning because I didn't want to stand in inches of water. The room had a nice flat screen TV but seemed a little smaller then the average room.

Although a little small, the indoor pool and hot tub were both wonderful along with the well appointed fitness room and computer lab with complimentary high speed internet. I loved the microwave and mini-fridge in the room along with the Neutrogena toiletries. The king size bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Be sure to stop by the lobby around 6:00pm/7:00pm every night for complimentary warm just-baked cookies.

I booked my room a few months in advance and found a great $149 rate. Everything about this HGI was great, from the speedy check-in, to the clean rooms, to the location, nothing could be better. What's really great is this hotel is literally steps from the Red Line stop at Grand. You walk up the stairs and the hotel is about 20 steps away which is very convenient if you're coming in on the train. For those that need any grocery items , there is a grocery store right around the corner where you can find items like soda without paying high hotel prices. I had a great view on the 21st floor and although this is just a standard HGI, the room was very clean and had a nice flat screen TV inside the room.

The location could not have been any better. We got off the Red Line of the &quot;L&quot;, walked up the steps and were right outside the lobby of the hotel. Rode the subway and buses everywhere we went, if we didn't walk from the hotel's central location. Also, there is a free trolley to/from Navy Pier that stops directly in front of the hotel. If it is too full, just grab a city bus (#29) that will also take you to Navy Pier.The front desk was very friendly, professional, and helpful. Since we arrived around noon, our room was not ready for check-in, so we left our luggage with the bellhop and were on our way to explore Chicago. When we came back, our room was ready and we retrieved our luggage.The hotel was very clean, well-appointed, and everything seemed to be in working order. I was bit concerned about noise based on other reviews but we had absolutely no problems, except the occasional siren outside but that will happen with any hotel in downtown Chicago.The pool area was nice but small.

However, I have noticed as the rates have dropped at this HGI due to the economic downturn I suppose you get the &quot;in town to party&quot; crowd and they are noisy coming and going all hours of the nights. If this wasn't enough noise, we were on the 22nd floor and you could hear people in the street wooping it up until the wee hours. There were many many sirens and you could hear traffic noise especially motorcycles. This is a very noisy hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",

The red line was literally right by the front door, the free Navy Pier trolley ran right by the hotel and most of the buses that you need for tourist items were only two blocks away. The staff was very friendly and the hotel was very clean. There is a parking garage next door where you can self park and save yourself some money.

Because the wonderful Homewood Suites next door was booked up, we were wound up staying here. I expected this hotel to be similar to the Homewood Suites. Instead, it was a complete disappointment. Sure, the staff was very helpful and friendly, and the rooms were very clean. However, ultimately, when you pay for a hotel room, you're paying for a place to sleep for the night. The Hilton Garden Inn is a total, complete and utter failure in this regard. The walls have absolutely no soundproofing at all. You can here your neighbor's TV, conversations, everything. One night, I got shaken awake by my neighbor who happened to like to blast his TV at 1:00 a.m. And mind you, all rooms are like this. I kept changing rooms, and they all have the same walls which seem to be made out of a thin piece of drywall, or possibly even cardboard. No matter which room you're in, you'll be able to here TV's and conversations from the rooms adjacent to you. This place also serves no breakfast, unless you're willing to pay a rediculous amount of money for cornflakes and a bagel. You're better off staying in a cheap motel. Cheap motels that I've stayed at had better services and better soundproofing than this Hilton Garden Inn. If you're just looking for a nice, quiet place to sleep, do not stay at this hotel. For what you get out of it, it is totally overpriced and generally not a pleasant place to be.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 27 2009 \\tgreat location low on staff\\tlocation was great, resterant on sight was good, indoor pool was clean, warm enough to enjoy, whirl pool great as well, great location, few steps from the red line metro. Had a few issues with lack of staff. Had no towels, called front desk, took about 4 hours to get towels. next day no one cleaned room at all. called front desk about 6pm, someone came about 830pm to clean, didnt get usa today either but other rooms did. Same deal the next day as well, did come to clean the third day...... no conceirge on hand, tried to wait on line to ask desk staff questions, they were busy and not very accomodating. Rooms were large and nice, location was great, close to everything, but don't expect service any time soon, very short on staff and it was obvious.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 25 2009 \\tMy first choice in Chicago\\tThis was our third time staying at the Hilton Garden Inn. We reserved the room through Priceline, spending only $65 per night. TIP: The &quot;two Queen bed&quot; rooms are much larger than the King rooms. THE PROS:The bedding is updated, there is a microwave, coffee maker, mini-fridge and flat screen TV. We LOVED the Jewel grocery store just steps from the hotel. It stays open until midnight, too, and sells beer, wine and liquor along with the usual grocery store items. (In my home state you have to go to a special store to by alcoholic beverages.) The entrance to the Red Line train is just outside the hotel door and Michigan Ave is just three blocks away. The location is great!Free in-room internet service - and it actually worked well! THE CONS:There is no High Def service to the TV, though, so everything on the TV looks stretched out. (No big deal.)The lobby is very bland and small - but who really cares about that?We didn't use the pool, hot tub or exercise room.We MUCH prefer the Hilton Garden Inn to the nearby Marriott. We take about four trips to Chicago each year and have stayed at several different places but the Hilton Garden Inn remains our favorite.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jul 23 2009 \\tGood Time had by Me\\tI stayed for one week while attending a business conference. Within easy walking distance to Navy Pier, Art Institute, theater district, etc. Grocery store and Starbucks both across the street. Clean, comfortable, and quiet room. Only downside...$15 for an in-room movie was steep, and a small selection of titles.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 19 2009 \\tGreat location!!\\tPretty much had nothing much to complain about the hotel. Except when we checked in the staff who checked us in did not smile or greet us and continue talking to other staff while serving us. With the brand name, I expect polite and caring staff, but we did not get it here. However, there's another staff later who's really attentive, so I guess we just got unlucky being served by that one lady during our check in time. Room was clean, comfortable, with free wireless internet and spacious bathroom. It's virtually close to everywhere, Magnificent mile, Millenium Park, Navy Pier, etc. Bear in mind that you have to pay extra for parking. For valet it's $44 and self park is $32. Overall I'm satisfied and recommend this to anyone.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 17 2009 \\tEverything You Could Want\\tI recently spent a week at this location for business. As I traveled around Chicago during the week, and visited friends at other hotels, I confirmed again and again that the Hilton Garden Inn is the best kept secret in Chicago. Being in the River North area is perfection. The train is steps away from the front door, there is a grocery across the street (with a surprisingly good natural food section on two aisles...don't be put off by all the processed junk you see as you enter the crowded space), a Trader Joe's two blocks away, Nordstrom across the street in a mall that fronts Michigan Ave for easy bus access, and restaurants everywhere you looked. My husband was thrilled that the Chicago Jazz Mart was a block away as well as an exceptional used bookstore. Spend too much and need to mail things home? There is a post office across the street from the grocery store. It just doesn't get better than this for location. Regarding the room, it was spacious, perfectly appointed, had a great city view, and was spotless day after day. My only small complaint was the bathtub was tiny and not the kind you can lean back in...too concave....so I relaxed in the hot tub near the pool each day. I also loved the business center with three computers, printers, fax machine and copy machine. Wonderful! Regarding noise, the whole city is noisy. That's Chicago. The hotel restaurant, Weber Grill, attracts a lot of lively traffic, but so does every other restaurant in the area. The weekend crowd was noticeably rowdier than the weekday crowd. This is not a sedate hotel for retirees, if you know what I mean. Ask for a room on the upper floors and don't hesitate to call the staff if you need assistance. They were great.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jul 11 2009 \\tThe staff went above and beyond to make our experience wonderful!\\tMy family and I were traveling to Frankfurt, Germany, and wanted a nonstop flight. Because we used to live in Chicago, we decided to spend a night in Chicago before flying to Germany since we could get a nonstop flight from Chicago.We Pricelined this hotel and got two rooms for $50/each. We planned for my husband to stay in one room with one of our children while I stayed in the other room with the other child (our children are 3 and 1). We inquired about adjoining rooms, however, and found that we were able to get adjoining rooms, which made life a lot easier. Since our flight to Frankfurt the next day was late in the evening, we asked to arrange a late checkout. They were so helpful that they allowed us to stay until 2:00 p.m. so that my kids could take naps.When we checked out, we asked Kristy at the front desk if there was any way she could arrange adjoining rooms for us again on our way back and she did just that.This was potentially a stressful trip for us, but it was made so much more pleasant just by the small things that the folks at HGI were willing to do for us. Oh, and the rooms were exceptionally comfortable and well-appointed!\\t\\n',\n",

The wait-staff did not know who we were, but they were so professional and excellent to our business party. We were given the attention the HIlton is famous for and the chef was excellent. Front desk politely and proficiently dealt with our particular concerns. We had international investors and when a bi-lingual computer IT professional was needed, Hilton staff was very polite and assisted us.\\t\\n',\n",

The Grand subway stop is located right in front of the hotel, which is an added plus if you're to/from the airport via the train.Hotel staff was friendly.Rooms were clean.If you're planning to take a late night dip in the pool (I.e. in the last hour before the pool closes, just a warning that this seems to be the time that many families take their kids swimming (maybe to tire them out??). The hot tub just isn't quite as relaxing with a bunch of 8 year-olds splashing around beside you. : (\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Jun 16 2009 \\tNice hotel in a great location\\tWe stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn June 11-14th, 2009. This was our second stay at this location. The first stay was great as well and we really liked the great location just off Michigan Avenue. This hotel is also just off the EL redline, at the Grand Avenue stop. There are a lot of dining and drinking options within walking distance too.Check in went very quickly, no lines. The room was clean and comfortable. Good beds, not too hard, not too soft, they had some sort of adjustable feature, but not like sleep number beds, it has a knob on the side, so I'm not sure how it really worked. We were on the 17th floor and did not have much of a view but that was ok with us. We were not in the room much. The rooms are good sized for Chicago also. (Some hotel rooms can be small there.) I recommend this hotel if you plan to use public transit. It is fast and easy to use in Chicago. We took the train to Wrigley Field for a baseball game on 2 days and also to the Sears Tower and Macys. We also visited the Frontera Fresco at Macy's (on State Street, 7th floor) and even saw Rick Bayless stop in to check on his quick service restaurant! That was unexpected! I've seen him at Frontera Grill and Topolobampo before at night, but I was shocked to see him here! We also dined at Shaw's Crab House, which was very good, though we ate in the Oyster Bar, not the main dining room, which is a bit louder atmosphere, but the same food. We also found a great mini golf course in Grant Park, which was very fun, called The Green at Grant Park. You can get a beer before, during or after you play mini golf. We enjoyed listening to the Blues Fest acts across the street while we golfed. Overall, we had a great second stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Chicago and I'd stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jun 13 2009 \\tGreat location great hotel\\tVery conveniently located. Across the street from the subway and just a couple of blocks to Michigan Ave. and buses. Nordstroms and Bloomies nearby along with all kinds of great restaurants. Room was large and very clean. Had a corner room with lots of light. Staff helpful. Booked on Hotwire for $76 a night so was delighted to find such a great hotel.\\t\\n',\n",

       " \"Jun 8 2009 \\tNext to perfect.\\tPlusses outweigh the minuses by far. On the plus side:+ immediately on the red line. Could not possibly be more convenient to public transit. Literally steps away. + but you may not even need the subway as the hotel is perfectly central &amp; within easy walking distance of everything downtown.+ very fluffy bed in contemporary and meticulously clean room+ attentive and cheerful check-in staff (went extra mile for us in several respects)+ taxi stand one block away for easy trips to airport or wherever else you may be headed. Minuses:- Breakfast at Weber Grill is mediocre at best. You're better off walking a block or two to any of the surrounding restaurants. (Gospel brunch at House of Blues, for example)- pool is small. (But why swim? You're in Chicago!) - elevator wait times can be a little frustrating - building could use one more elevator. - a little pricey, I guess. Hard to say. Long story short, a lovely stay at a lovely hotel. I won't hesitate to stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",

When I decided to call to confirm our reservation the afternoon of the night we were scheduled to arrive, I was told there was no reservation under my name. Come to find out, an error had somehow been made and we were booked at a different Hilton. We were able to come to a compromise, however. This hotel is very conveniently located downtown within walking distance of many shops, restaurants....Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. Pool/hottub were decent, although quite small. This was a family vacation for us and we were overall impressed with the hotel. *TIP* Park your own car for much cheaper....just park near an elevator in the parking ramp....it's the same place for valet parking!!\\t\\n\",\n",

The Mariott and Hampton have been a better experience for myself and was just a little more money per night. Paper thin walls that everyone can hear you and neighbors will complain when coming back from the night. You only get one personal warning and the second time they come up they will kick you out by force. We were literally in the hotel for 30 minutes before we were told we were being kicked out. We were kicked out with excessive force by police after trying to negotiate with the manager who was stuck on kicking us out. We had 8 police officers escort people who were quiet by the time the officers came. Not worth the cost for people enjoying the city or even for business trips since everyone can hear everything. I've already told our sales force to never book any nights here and instead, we go to the Marriott now.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"May 7 2009 \\tPrepaid Suite Reservations But No Room At This Inn!\\tOh my, I was so disappointed with my recent trip to Chicago. My sister, daughter and I had tickets to the Oprah Show. I made reservations for us to have a suite at the Hilton Garden Inn, Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile. I prepaid the reservation, as I wanted to guarantee that we would have our suite. We live in Cincinnati, and instead of flying, we decided to make the five hour trip by driving. I wanted to have a suite so we could have a better place to unwind. We arrived at the hotel, and I gave the valet our car, and he parked it. We went inside to check in. We were greeted promptly, and given our room keys. Off we went to see our little suite! Imagine my surprise when we opened the door to the suite, and we walked into a tiny room with two queen beds, which consumed the room. I immediately called the front desk to tell them a mistake had been made. A bad sign - it took me about five minutes to speak to someone at the front desk. The gentleman at the front desk, John, told me that I didn't have a suite reservation. I then told him I had written confirmation, and that I had prepaid - which the check-in person had already noted that I had prepaid my room. &quot;John&quot; said that the room that I was in was just as good as a suite, and I should be happy there. WHAT???? I told him I was not happy, as we had three adults, and I had advised that three adults were staying there in my online reservation request, and then I learned the truth. All of the suites were taken. I told John that I wanted him to find me another suite in another hotel. John said o.k., and about ten minutes later, I called back downstairs, and he told me that he had miraculously been able to get a room at the Embassy Suites, and we were so lucky!!! So, the three of us head downstairs to be taken to the Embassy Suites. This jerk is at the front desk when we go downstairs, and he is trying to ignore us. The young man who checked us in asked us, &quot;Is there a problem with your room?&quot; And I told him, &quot;Yes, we don't have a room, as my suite has evidently been given away, even though I prepaid for the suite.&quot; That young man was apologetic, and he asked who we had spoken to. Then the rude guy, John, comes over, and says, &quot;Go over to the Embassy Suites, turn right, and it is about a block down.&quot; Did I mention it was pouring rain???? So we walk through the rain, and go check in at the Embassy Suites. They request a credit card, so I give them my Amex, which they promptly charge the &quot;suite.&quot; The next day when we check out, we have to traipse back over to the Hilton from the Embassy, with our luggage in tow, to re-claim our car from valet parking. Nice, huh? I have to go back inside the Hilton so that they can do a separate charge for the valet parking, but I can't seem to get anyone to issue me a credit for the suite that I had prepaid for. I called the Hilton tonight, and I talked to someone who told me to leave a vm for the manager. I have now left her a vm, and I am awaiting a phone call to see what remedy is available for me. I am so disgusted by this hotel's treatment of their guests. Unbelievable!We did eat at two terrific restaurants, and I will review them separately. They were Weber's Grill and Shaw's Restaurant/Seafood. Yummy!\\t\\n\",\n",

Found maid service to be great- even picked up some of my kid's toys/stuffed animals they had laid around. Bought an all day bus/train pass at Jewel Osco across the street and very easy to get around. Also join your local science museum at home and it got us free reciprical access to Museum of Science and Industry, Field Museum, Alder planetarium, and children museum at Navy Pier.Pros- Super location- within walking distance to Mich. avenue, El train line right at corner, bus stop close, grocery store and many restaurants/shopping within one or two blocks. Valet parking was high like most hotels in area but self parking (no in or out) was $29 a day which is cheaper than other hotels nearby. Microwave and refrig in room. Neutragena toiletries. Flat screen tv. Small but adequate pool and hot tub. Business center had free internet access which came in handy.Cons- Suzette at the front desk wasn't the most informative or friendly but she wasn't there everyday either thankfully and 2 out of 3 elevators were broken on the Sunday morning we tried to check out -more than 20 minutes just trying to leave the building but maid was nice enough to let us on the working freight elevator.\\t\\n\",\n",

We mostly chose this hotel for its proximity to the Red Line - it is directly outside the front doors. We had a very friendly check-in and our room was very clean and spacious. The bathroom had great toiletries and the beds were very comfortable. The pool was small but clean and included a hot tub. The business center had free internet and the valet guys outside were always VERY friendly and helpful. One of them even walked in the pouring rain for 15 minutes to get us a cab!A couple suggestions though: if street noise might bother you, request a room on a higher floor. There is no continental breakfast, but there is a Jewel/Osco right across the street (great because you have an in-room fridge). Parking is also steep - $40/day.\\t\\n',\n",

The woman at the front desk said she had to pull up my reservation first. Then she asked me how i was going to pay for the valet parking (which I never had in the first place). After explaining to her that I self parked, with an attitude she told me that the hotel was fully booked and not to take any longer than 30 mins. (As if everyone is really rushing to Chicago right now for some reason!?) Anyways, as I was saying &quot;thank you&quot; just to be polite, she hung up on me. I stayed there 2 days and after the first night, the room wasn't cleaned until late afternoon. Also, the first day we found old drinks in the refrigerator that had already expired. The room directory is outdated and not specific.\\t\\n\",\n",

I recommend the Jewel/Osco mini mart across the street on State Street for nibbles or morning bakery.Minuses? The room by the elevator and ice machine was very noisy and there's all the big city siren noise. Ask for a room further down the hall to eliminate that.\\t\\n\",\n",

The hotel hallways and room doors are not insulated at all so you can hear everything from outside your room and noise that travels from one room to the next via the hall. That was the worst part of our stay.-If the noise issue was resolved somehow it would have been much better.\\t\\n',\n",

Let me start by saying this hotel is perfectly located in the heart of downtown, close to the red line train, shopping and numerous great places to eat. The check in was polite and fast. I got up to my room and was surprised how clean and modern the room was. Flat screen T.V. king size foam bed, comfortable enough for me but if you like a bed that is on the firm side you may not like this one. The room also had a fridge and microwave which was nice! The bathroom was spotless! There were two concerns though, one was the common halls had an echo and some guests don't seem to think of others at one o' clock in the morning yelling slamming doors etc. Second the AC/HEATING UNIT kept coming on for 10 or 15 seconds at a time all through the night! Annoying! And very loud! This was after I switched it off! After the first night I went down to the front desk to notify them of this problem and they sent somebody up to the room(I guess while I was out) to try to fix this, but the second and last night I stayed the same problem happened again. The front desk staff did ask me if the problem was fixed but after I said &quot;No&quot; she didn't seem to care to much. I would recommend this hotel if your a &quot;deep sleeper.&quot;\\t\\n\",\n",

The rooms are nicely appointed for a midrange chain with updated furniture, Aeron desk chairs, comfortable beds with clean white duvet covers, and flat screen TV's. (see my photographs) They have an extended cable line up including HGTV. There is a microwave and refrigerator (not a mini-bar) in each room--it is right across the street from a grocery store. No safe provided. Wi-Fi is free and works well. The pool is small and there is a whirlpool. The fitness center contains a few basic machines; there was a sign on the door saying free guest passes were available to Crunch fitness a block away. There is a parking garage right next to the hotel...self parking was about 25 per day...a bargain for downtown Chicago. The hotel is right in the River North district, two blocks off Michigan Avenue. Close to River North restaurants and nightlight. Near Nordstroms for shopping. Weber Grill restaurant is just off the lobby. I would recommend this hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",

The location is magnificent, 2 blocks from the Michigan Ave., less than 20 meters to the Red Line MTA train that takes you virtually everywhere. Nice view (floor 17). The pool is very good and also the business center (complimentary use of PC and printer). Within the hotel there is free wifi.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Feb 15 2009 \\tAverage HGI in a Great Location\\tLet's start with the new HGI mattress which is foam, offers little bounce, and is, overall very stiff and partially contouring. It was right up my alley, and one of the more comfortable beds in the Hilton chain, but if you're a soft bed sleeper you're going to have real problems with the standard issue mattress at this and every other HGI.The room is clean and quality. The noon checkout time is a significant perk for those of us who are not early risers.The front desk will tell you the breakfast ends at 10:30 when it actually ends at 10. Not something you want to find out at 10:05 a.m.Not a big fan of the Weber Grill restaurant, personally but you could do worse for dinner on a bad weather/late night.Great location, helpful, polite front desk staff.While the room walls are soundproof, the pass through and external doors are not.Aside from a non functioning smoke alarm (somewhat disturbing to have it hanging off the wall), this is an average HGI that isn't overpriced with a great location and nice views.One other important note. The room is very, very dry. If you stay at this hotel and require a somewhat humid room for either health reasons or a cold, I'd recommend a humidifier.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 10 2009 \\tLocation and Efficiency\\tI booked the hotel in Hotwire after seen that I could get a room for $56 a night. I had a reservation at one of the Marriots and decided to save the $30 difference per night.I have been to Chicago several times and I have stayed in different hotels, and I really enjoyed my stay here. The location is the best. You can walk everywhere. If you need to get around, the &quot;Grand&quot; station of the Red line of the L is literally at the hotel's door. My room was very clean, and it was very comfortable for relaxing as well as for working. The heat worked perfectly. Front desk staff was efficient. The housekeeping staff was extremely nice. One thing that I really appreciate is the room's refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave. There is a grocery store across the street. From the hotel you can walk any where: shopping , theater, Navy Pier, Park, etc.Cons:There is construction near by, and the hotel is about a block from the fire station, so there is some noise. Some how a lot of the guests do not realize that the metal doors of the rooms are probably a required for safety purposes and do not need to be slammed, and you can hear people talking on the halls, specially the typical screaming children, but I this is not the hotel fault.I will definitely recommend it, and I will stay there again if I can. It is not ultimate luxury, but it gets the work done flawlessly if efficiency and location at a reasonable price is what you are looking for.\\t\\n\",\n",

I also am a former Hilton Diamond Member.I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years, with the last stay having some major issues. The stay was so bad, Hilton sent a voucher to come again for a free nights stay. I let it expire and just recently decided to give the hotel a second try for a 9 night stay.Hotel Positives: Great location. Two blocks from Michigan Avenue, 1 block from State St. A grocery across the street, 1 1/2 blocks to Starbucks, and some fabulous restaurants within 3 blocks. Also, the red line is just out the front door for easy city transport.Hotel Negatives:Customer service, poor room cleaning, poor management.Before arriving, I called and told the manager that my last experience here was subpar and I was coming back and would like a smooth, stress free stay. The manager offered to honor the free night even though it was expired. Here is a snapshot of the stay:1st night; Heater was broken and made a clanking noise every 26 seconds the whole night.2nd day: The hotel had many key problems and issues. Enough to send apology letters out.3rd day.....okay4th day:Verbally insulted, lied to, and hung up on by April over a newspaper. Asked to speak with manager, she refused...said she couldn't leave a note for the manager unless she was told what about. Hung up on!!Spoke with manager about the matter, only to have him smirk and have very unprofessional demeanor.5th day: the room was half cleaned. Arrived at night to a room with a dirty sink and toilet, no towels, dirty glasses, no toiletries. Called down and asked, and in return received towels, cups, and a bag of coffee/cream6th day:Return to the room in evening to again find an uncleaned room. Towels were left on bed..not in bathroom.7th day: okay8th day; Room partially cleaned again. No towels again!9th day: Went to check out and took the voucher down to be credited. Two managers had said they would be glad to honor it evn though it had expired. Gave it to Ronnie at the front desk, she said she would credit it. Two hours later, go to check out and notice it was never taken off. She then says it can't be used, even though 2 managers said they would take it. (It was their offer, not mine as I had said it was expired.....and only wanted a SMOOTH stay). Spend 1 hour arguing over the fact that they were renegging. Finally had to call Hilton Corporate, who then called the hotel and made them credit the voucher.After all this, never did get a formal apology and never heard from the GM....only shift managers. Very poor service. Yes, the location is great, but Embassy Suites is across the street (1 block) and Homewood Suites are 1 block as well. Stay at one of those\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dec 29 2008 \\tExcellent Stay\\tExcellent hotel and location. Walking distance to many attractions. Close to the Red line subway. $30.00 taxi ride from Midway, always cabs available outside of Hilton Garden Inn. Front desk people were more than helpful. They were intelligent, polite and knowledgeable. Portillos hotdogs/beef sandwiches about 3 blocks away. Starbucks outside and across the street, grocery store across the street. The rooms were clean and nice, beds were comfortable, tv was nice flat screen. All and all just the best place to stay with the best rates. Also a PF Changs right there too.\\t\\n',\n",

However some recent stays with some issues has caused me to change my thoughts.You can't beat the location just a few blocks off Michigan Ave. Right across the street is a Jewel/Osco grocery store. Tons of restaurant options and the Red Line EL stop is right outside the front doors.They've also done some remodeling with new carpet and wallpaper in the hallways. Plus they've installed 37&quot; HDTVs in the rooms. However all they have is standard definition, and it looks bad.Plus the AC/heating units are showing their age. It's hard to maintain a comfortable temperature plus they are extremely loud.Plus the internet (both wired and wireless) was down. The front desk didn't apologize and said it would be fixed in a few days.Lastly getting our room serviced was an issue a couple of times even though we were gone by 9am and didn't return until late.\\t\\n\",\n",

First, there is the red line right outside the door. Nordstrom's is to your left and a full service Starbucks to the right. It was within walking distance of magnificent mile-an easy walk to all stores and afun walk to Grant Park.The hotel has room service and a small Starbucks downstairs. The rooms are a nice size with very comfortable beds with comfort adjustable mattresses(for the king anyway). Staff was veryvfriendly and so helpful. You can't go wrong staying here.\\t\\n\",\n",

Our room was perfect-microwave and niced size dorm refrig. the grocery store across the street is a full size store (vs convenience store) and we were able to buy breakfast and sandwich fixings for our stay-HUGE $ savings from buying items at the convention site. They have a nice business center with 4 complimentary computers and printers. we were able to print concert tickets, directions, etc. very nice. The hotel is a short walk to Michigan Ave (3-4 half blocks). I am looking forward to planning a non business trip to Chicago and we will definitely stay at this hotel again!!\\t\\n\",\n",

Get there early.\\t\\n',\n",

Decided to stay downtown, and the Hilton had very good rates compared to similar hotels. Staff was very friendly and efficient. Room was nice, and the kids enjoyed the pool while I made use of the whirlpool. You can self park next door with the validated rate of $26/day vs. $44 to valet. The hotel is a perfect location, near enough to Michigan Ave to walk, and a Red Line subway stop in front of the hotel. I would have liked to have a breakfast included with the room... that was the only draw back.\\t\\n',\n",

We booked 3 rooms - 1 for myself - 1 for a co worker - 1 for a customer.Everyone was very pleased. It was super convenient to everything. Even the subway was right downstairs (which, normally, we take a cab to Wriglyville - however, it was 5pm on a tuesday and we knew it would take extra long in traffic - highly reccommended!) The restaurant/bar downstairs is very nice - everyone was very friendly. However, it does close fairly early. Breakfast was included for our HHonors and served at the same restaurant - a lot to choose from! The rooms were big, clean, and modernly decorated. A++++ Will be back!\\t\\n\",\n",

An easy walk to Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, the Loop, etc. There is a Jewel supermarket directly across the street as well, so no need to spend a fortune on the morning buffet. A clean hotel with attentive staff.Downsides: parking is not cheap ($26 w/o in-out privileges per day, or $44 for daily valet with unlimited in-out); pool is quite small and gets crowded quickly; rooms are a little on the small side.Overall, a good place to stay to be near much of what Chicago has to offer.\\t\\n',\n",

I've heard a lot of people say 'oh there's nothing to do in Chicago!' but it's a fantastic city to visit! I preferred it to New York. There's amazing architecture in all the high rise buildings, great shopping, parks, the Navy Pier, beaches, there's a great boat ride round the Lake ...what more could you ask for. Also as I travelled alone I found it pretty safe, the tourist bus is the best way to get about.I chose the Hilton as it was a pretty good hotel rate for downtown Chicago and very central. I wanted a nice, safe hotel as I was alone and had never been to Chicago before. The hotel was in a perfect location, lots of restaurants close by and cheap places to eat - McDonalds is down the street! It's only a 15 minute walk to Navy Pier and the beach and Magnificient Mile is just a short 5 miniute walk away. Lincoln Park zoo is a approx 50 minute walk.The hotel rooms were fantastic, really big and comfortable luxury beds - just perfect. I never ate at the hotel so can't comment on that. The only downside is that the hotel staff were very rude, every time I asked them how to get somewhere they would snap back 'get a cab' which was not very helpful as a tourist! I didn't let it spoil my trip though!I would recommend this hotel and 4 days is long enough to spend in Chicago and enjoy the city.have fun!\\t\\n\",\n",

The hotel staff was very helpful and they give you a validation code for your parking which saves you like $10 a day! The room was very nice and clean. We stayed on the 20th floor and had great views. The location was great-we were in walking distance from shopping, millenium park and the rriver. We did take the free trolley to Navy Pier, and the bus to Lincoln Park. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant (Weber Grill) but it was always busy. We would have probably eaten there if we had one more day, but did snag some cheesecake from there and took it up to our room one night! Overall a great experience. We would recommend to anyone, couples or families.\\t\\n\",\n",

The room was spacious and very clean, plus you get free wireless. The location is excellent, just a couple of blocks from Michigan Avenue with plenty of shopping and great restaraunts all around. Went to the Rock Bottom Brewery across the street and the food and overall atmosphere was very good (rooftop bar is great in the summertime). They don't have a breakfast at the hotel but the staff recommended an excellent place a few blocks away (Mary's Cafe) that was definitely affordable. If you want to go to Navy Pier, the hotel staff also recommended that you could take a free trolley 2 blocks away. You also get a discount if you park in the garage attached to the hotel ($16 if I remember right). Overall, I would definitely stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",

The hotel was spotless, had a real nice gym area and pool, with a very helpful staff.Their Internet is hard wired and seemed slow, but that's the only thing I could even think about that was less than excellent.The city view from our room was a real plus.Be sure and do the fireworks at Navy Pier and if you like some nightlife, check out Redheads piano bar a few blocks away.Avoid UNO pizza!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 6 2008 \\tGreat hotel at a great location\\tVery nice hotel and a perfect location. Free internet! The internet is through an ethernet cable, but who cares if you can't carry your laptop around your room. I didn't try the complimentary breakfast, but you are in Chicago. Get out of the hotel and try some of the best food in the world.Footsteps away from the CTA red line. When you walk out of the hotel the stairs to the red line train are directly to the right. If you are familiar with riding the train in Chicago, it is perfect. If you are there to see a Cubs game, you get on the northbound red line train, and get off at the Addison stop which drops you off at the stadium.The hotel's entrance has an unloading area on Grand that is convenient for pulling into for unloading your group and luggage. An attendant will ask if you will be valet parking. Valet is $40 per day with in and out privileges. Self-parking is $26 per day after you have the parking ticket validated at the front desk. The regular price on the sign in the garage is $35 per day. The self-parking garage is connected to the hotel with entrances on both Grand and Ohio. If you are planning on parking your car and leaving it during your stay, this is the way to go. If you do self-parking, ask for the front desk to validate your ticket before you leave. When it is time to depart, you'll then insert your card into an automatic payment machine just outside the lobby to the right that you can pay with a credit card or cash.When I go back to Chicago, I am definitely going to be staying at the Hilton Garden Inn - Downtown.\\t\\n\",\n",

The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the room had a refrigerator, coffee pot, and free internet access. It is located just 2-3 blocks from Michigan Avenue and is near a lot of restaurants and shopping. Several theatres are within a short walk (5-6 blocks). The only negative was that housekeeping did not attempt to clean our room until after 5:00 pm when we were getting ready for dinner and a show. I would stay here again.\\t\\n',\n",

Our room was clean and neat throughout our stay. We got to stay on the 22nd floor, which had fantastic views. Our children enjoyed the pool several times during our stay. The staff was wonderful.One item that not too many people mention is the convenience of having a refrigerator and a microwave in our hotel room. There is a grocery store right across the street, and we were able to stock up on sodas, waters, orange juice, fruit, etc., at very reasonable prices. We even purchased cold cuts for sandwiches and had lunch in our rooms, to help save money. Every bit helps!We had an excellent stay, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the hotel itself is in a perfect location. I would recommend it to anyone.\\t\\n',\n",

The room was nice enough...However, the problems began as we checked in for our one night stay. Rude staff were the norm. For instance, we had a couple of little questions and needed directions, pretty standard stuff, but the staff ignored us and when we did get their attention, seemed very put-out. And we're Hilton Honors members!There were also lots of little inconveniences: - very little sound proofing, so we heard EVERYTHING that took place in the hallway all night long.- no WiFi, just plugged-in internet (so you have to keep your laptop on the desk in the corner when in the room)- the printing services that were advertised did not work (and again, no one was available to help us use them)- we ran out of toothpaste, and found there were no complimentary toiletries if you forgot something, purchase for $5 plus only.And, at the attached restaurant, absolutely the WORST breakfast buffet I have ever had in a hotel. We had to leave early, so it was one of the only places open at that hour. Big mistake. Even at 6:30am, the food was cold, stale and generally bad. The omelettes, made to order, were the only good option available. And this for something like $15. I'm sure it's good for other meals, but avoid the breakfast!I'm confident you can find something better in Chicago for this price.\\t\\n\",\n",

We enjoyed the pantry and Starbucks found in the lobby.The front desk staff were curtious and quick with a map when we asked for directions. There were no problems checking our luggage at the front desk for a few hours after we had checked out.We did not have time to eat at the Weber Grill restaurant found within the hotel but we heard it was great.One downfall outside of the hotel's control... We chose the hotel for it's close proximity to a red line 'L' stop, but found that stop closed upon arrival. The red line next stop was about 4-5 blocks walking distance. If you're choosing the hotel based on it's proximity to the 'L', call ahead to check the status of the stop - we were told the stop has been closed often on weekends for repair.Overall, a very pleasant stay.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 25 2008\\tGreat Location\\tJust got back from Chicago and wanted to write my review while everything is fresh in my mind. We arrived in the early afternoon and our room wasn't ready. Check in was at 3pm, so that was fine. They held our bags and we did some sightseeing. Returned to the hotel and our room was ready. On first entering our room which was 1711 there was a slight odor. Not bad or anything. Then when I went into the bathroom, there was a mildewy smell. I really hate that smell. But it wasn't so bad to ask for a room change. There is no fan in the bathroom and with no air circulation, the mildewy smell is going to occur. So those are some things that bugged me. The staff at the front desks changes often. Most of the staff isn't really that helpful. We asked once for a restaurant recommendation and was given the answer &quot;there are a lot of restaurants, here is a list&quot;. That isn't really what I was looking for. Then we asked directions several times and they just weren't helpful and didn't seem to care. There is one perk. Warm cookies are offered around 6:30 to 7:30 and I think again a bit later in the evening. The red line train stops right in front of the hotel so that is another plus. The location is great. Close to everything. I don't think I would stay here again, without attempting to try another hotel first. It isn't that I had a bad stay, but I think I could have had a bit of a nicer room without the smells and staff that would love to help me more.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 10 2008 \\tGlad I was moved here\\tI was originally booked at The Silversmith for my trip to Chicago for NeoCon, however because I had booked through Orbitz my room was not guaranteed and The Silversmith was oversold. They moved me to the HGI, and I'm glad they did! It was closer to the Merch Mart so I could walk there instead of taking a cab, there are many restaurants nearby including the Weber Grill attached to the hotel, the service was great and the room very comfortable. Because I arrived around 11 am, I had the choice of waiting for a regular King room or taking a King Wheelchair room right away, and I took the Wheelchair room. I don't think the room size is much different, but the bathroon is big enough for a wheelchair to spin donuts in and has a wheel-in shower with a &quot;rain&quot; style showerhead. The beds are interesting, they are like a Sleep Number bed with controls on each side to change the comfort level. A refrigerator and microwave were much appreciated, and FREE wired internet access (the first free access I have come across in Chicago!). My only complaint is that the drapes do not cover the entire window. There is a 3-4 foot space above the A/C unit that the sheers cover, but not the drapes, and the morning sun shone right on my pillow. It's a good thing Ineeded to be up early! Also there was some sort of computer issue when I checked in, and when I returned to my room the afternoon of the 2nd day my keys didn't work. When I went to the desk, I was told that I had only been booked for one night, but when I showed them my receipt from the Silversmith stating it was a two-night trip they fixed the error quickly with no hassles. All in all I enjoyed my stay here and am glad I was moved!\\t\\n\",\n",

Two blocks north of the river, two blocks west of the Magnificent Mile, with a subway stop right at the corner.The room was very clean, plenty big, lots of towels. The mattresses are air-filled, with a control on each side - we played with them, but couldn't tell the difference in settings. They were comfortable - we really couldn't tell that they weren't regular mattresses.Even though we were on the 15th floor there was a lot of street noise - but we live in the country, so we probably notice it more than most.The front desk staff was efficient and friendly, the valets were very nice, and they have a small area next to the front desk where you can purchase snacks and such 24 hours/day.I would definitely stay there again.\\t\\n\",\n",

However, it's not quiet. There is a substantial gap at the bottom of each door, so hallway conversations and door slamming will be clearly audible. The windows have good sound insulation but the AC units do not, so traffic noise and sirens pour in at all hours.I liked it well enough, but the noise coming in was loud enough that it kept my three year old from getting to sleep. I understand it's a hotel in the middle of the city, but that's too loud.\\t\\n\",\n",

I love the location (close to many restaurants, shopping, and night life). Our room was very comfortable and quiet. We may not have had immediate neighbors because we didn't hear any of the other guests. The bathroom and tolietries were nice and the bed was comfortable. We had coupons for the complimentary buffet (might have been because my boyfriend has a high status in Hilton Reward Points) and it was very filling.

       " 'Mar 27 2008 \\tGood Value\\tI spent five nights at the Hilton Garden having read the reviews on tripadivsor. My room was clean, quiet, with a comfortable bed-- all at a really good rate. However, this is not a high service hotel which is just fine based on the rate and convenient location. My biggest complaint was the total absence of door help when I arrived from a very long 9 hour flights with 3 bags I had to navigate through two door with no help. There were 3 front desk people watching me, a 60 year old woman, struggling with this process, but no help came to my aid. However, my check-in clerk did thoughtfully put me in a higher floor room so it would be quiet. The room they were going to put me in was on the 1st floor where I could enjoy the roadwork being done right outside. Housekeeping was a little goofy. I never had the same towel count twice but it was just me so it was not a problem. The creamers they leave for your coffee were also often not left, but the front desk always sent up some when I called.My room was quiet as long as no one was in the hall making noise. There was a half inch space between the door and threshold to my room so hall noise came right in. A family group staying in multiple rooms around me were really loud but I could not hear them once they got into their rooms.I was most pleased with the comfortable bed and having a frig with microwave. Overall a good value for the rate. But if they raised the rate, I would choose a higher service hotel as a single travelers.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Mar 19 2008 \\tExcellent!\\tFor a reasonably priced hotel in downtown Chicago, this place is hard to beat. The rooms are smallish, but clean and recently updated. The bed in my room was extremely comfortable, there was a fridge and microwave, a great office chair, and a well designed bathroom. The staff were universally excellent, especially the valet parking guys, who deserve special praise for being friendly, quick and efficient.One quibble: no Wi-Fi in the rooms, just an Ethernet connection with a cable that doesn't very far past the desk. On the positive side, there's a 24-hour business centre that allows guests to print documents either on site or from their rooms. Also, the heater is pretty noisy, so if you tend to be cold at night and are also sensitive to white noise, this may not be the place for you.Breakfast at Weber's downstairs is an extortionate $15, and Mary's Diner down the street serves bland and greasy food. There's a Starbucks in the lobby that's open only in the morning, another around the corner that's open all day long, and a local chain called Cos a block east, which serves breakfast bagels, etc. Not a gourmet experience, but definitely edible. Otherwise the location is fantastic -- within walking distance of all the attractions of the Magnificent Mile, easy access to the El, etc.I'd definitely stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",

My only quibbles were that I had an ajoining room where the folks through the connecting door were loud, very loud at 2am in the morning and you could hear everything between the doors. It also took me awhile to figure out how to use the bath and shower but I figured it out.I would recommend the hotel, if you're going there though check out Mary's for breakfast ~ head out the front door and go left 4 blocks and it's there.\\t\\n\",\n",

The bathroom was clean with Neutrogena products provided. There was a microwave and small fridge. The bed was wonderful, very fluffy pillows. I did not want to crawl out after a great night's sleep.

The housekeeping did an exceptional job everyday we stayed there.The location was excellant also, very easy to walk to the Magnificent Mile and into the city.

       " \"Jan 12 2008 \\tGood base of operations\\tI'll preface by saying the hotel is being renovated and should be complete in March; we stayed on an &quot;old&quot; floor, so take some things in stride. We went for a weekend shopping trip and booked a room because of a decent price and good location. The check-in and all interactions with the staff was excellent. They were friendly, professional, informative, helpful and always pleasant.  The room seemed small at first because of the dark colors, but is really adequate with a small kitchenette &amp; nice work area. The work station had a nice-sized desk, comfortable office chair and was well lit. I don't hear well, so if I note it, it is definitely loud. The old heat/cooling unit was rather loud (and annoying). The sirens from below bothered my wife (we were on the 14th floor). It wasn't a busy weekend, but we both heard everything in the hallway. The bed was comfortable for me, too soft for my wife. The bathroom was clean, and the rest of the room seemed okay, but had some suspicious deficiencies, such as stains on the chair, drapery, wall and ceiling (don't ask me!). The TV hutch was very dusty on top (we were going to store some purchases out of the way there...we decided against it). The carpet probably could have used a good cleaning. I'm not sure how much they've been delaying maintenance because of the renovation, so some issues might be rectified by. (To be fair, I did not contact the management about the situation). Room service is from either the Weber Grill (on the ground floor) or from Buca de Beppo (on block east). We had ribs at the Weber Grill (they were good) but that's another story. Given the service, price and location, and assuming that the renovations reduce the noise and cleanliness issues, we would recommend this property as a good base for your time in downtown Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " 'Jan 4 2008\\tPoor Customer Service from Maid to Manager\\tNot a place to stay for the customer service or the price. I hope this keeps at least one person or more from staying here. Maid service will knock on your door at 7:30 regardless of Do not distrub sign. I stay mostly at Hilton properties (Hilton Honors Gold Member) and this has been the worst. I called the front desk to have the maid comeback and she continued to try to get into the room until I opened the door and said go away. When I checked out they were no apologies or resolution. I was told that they were busy and wanted to have the room ready for the next guest. Checkout time was 11 and I was not able to check into the room until after 4pm when I arrived 3 days earlier. It was a total lack of respect that was undeserved. Hotel Management was no help and did not speak very good english. They would not return calls and I registered a complaint with the Honors line. Even the Hampton Inn has a policy of 100% satisfaction. This does not extend to the Hilton Garden. I work for a major Vendor and attend the RSNA every year. I will not stay there again and have instructed my travel agent who books room in June for this conference not to place anyone there if at all possible. Gold Hilton Honors Member.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jan 2 2008 \\tGreat location and value\\tThe Hilton Garden Inn Downtown/Magnificent Mile provides good accommodations, great location, and a reasonable price. Located at State/Grand, the hotel: is a couple of blocks from the Magnificent Mile shopping area, has a subway station (Grand, on Red Line) right at its door, and has numerous restaurants in walking distance. Rooms are not lavish or large, but are clean and decent, provide a mini-fridge, mini-microwave and coffee maker. Small business center has 3 computers with free Internet access (used by a couple of teenaged girls surfing MySpace when I was there). There is a small pool and tiny fitness room. Weber Grill restaurant is a decent chain-type bar/restaurant for steaks/ribs/burgers.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jan 1 2008\\tA great hotel\\tThis hotel was great, especially for the price and location. I was expecting a dump becasue it was so cheap and I don't like to read many reviews before staying somewhere because I tend to remember other people's comments. We paid around $100/night for the weekend before X-mas, which was a great deal. The room was clean, the beds were very comfortable and I enjoyed the free wireless internet and in-room fridge. The rooms were on the medium side, but who goes to Chicago to sit in their room? The front desk staff were VERY nice and offered us a free shopping map that was very helpful. We parked in the hotel ramp and paid $22/night to park. This is CHEAP by Chicago standards!! I paid $40/night to park a block away last year. The location is GREAT and is very close to the Mag mile. There's also ESPN zone across the street, a close McDonalds and a new Subway practically kitty-korner to the hotel. We went at lunch and it was empty becasue they are new and it's kind of off the beaten path.  Weber Grill is in the lobby-area and you can smell grilled food in the hotels hallways, even 22 floors up, but the rooms DO NOT smell. We heard a lot of people in the halls, but no one in the next room. Also, Chicago is a loud city and you'll hear sirens all night, but this has happened at every hotel I've stayed in Chicago. The pool area is small, but if you just want to relax for a while, it'll work.  I would definatley stay in this hotel again. You can look, but you will not find another quality hotel this close to the Mag Mile for this price. I'm pretty picky about nice hotels and this one passed by standards.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 30 2007\\tvery convenient great value\\tI would return here for a clean, safe, comfortable place in an ideal central location for touring, with great service at the front desk. We stayed at the Peninsula a few years ago and that is a knock-your-socks-off world class luxury hotel. This is not -- it's a nice business class Hilton family property. But I would actually prefer to return to this one, instead of the Peninsula, because it is more centrally located, and I don't need to pay for all that luxury when we are out touring all day. We like to walk, and we were able to walk to the boat tours, the old Marshall Field in the Loop, Berghoff, the Sears Tower, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile and the Hancock building, all from the HGI. The Peninsula was a little bit further north, less convenient to the Loop, and so we found ourselves using many more cabs. We had a great lunch at Berghoff (weekday lunches on the main floor are as good as ever, including the homemade root beer) and we also had a lot of fun at dinner and great traditional food in a German neighborhood place to the north, the Chicago Brauhaus in Lincoln Square.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dec 19 2007 \\tI can see clearly\\tI was in Chicago to have lasik surgery and the lasik center recommended this hotel because it was close and they give a discount for people going to the center. We got there before check in because of my appointment time and the front desk was great. The room was not ready but said that they would keep our bags and take them to the room when it was ready. The woman working at the desk and the gentleman that helped with the bags were so nice. They both ask how I was doing when I got back from the center and also told us about the restaraunts in the area. It was a great stay!!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Dec 16 2007 \\tDisappointed......\\tThis hotel has so many good reviews that we decided to book it for our two week stay in Chicago. 2 years ago, we stayed in the Palmer House Hilton so thought we'd try its little sister!We're now in the second week of our stay and I must say, I'm really disappointed in the hotel. Don't get me wrong, the hotel itself is ideally placed with the red line El (Grand) right outside the door and the Mag Mile within walking distance. Also, the staff are friendly and the room bigger than expected, clean and tidy.Our main issue is noise. From everywhere. We're on the 13th floor and can hear absolutely everything either of our neighbours does, especially when in the bathroom which is embarrassing for both parties! You can hear word for word everything your neighbour says if you're in the bathroom whilst they're talking in their own room. At nightime, you can hear the toilets flushing on either side and if someone decides to have a late night/early morning bath or shower then believe me, you'll know about it!Also, even with the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign positioned on your door, you'll be sure to hear the maids as they go about their daily duties, shouting out to each other from the other end of the corridor. We've also had other guests stand outside our door and have animated conversations on their mobiles, or with other guests in the middle of the night. The air conditioning unit is another story altogether and for the first few nights, ours was coming every ten minutes then going off again. We reported this and were advised an engineer would look at it but haven't heard anything since. We've came up with our own way of making sure the outburts are now shorter so our sleep isn't disturbed too much during the night.We considered asking for a room move but reckon all the rooms must be the same, we've came to the conclusion that the walls are made of tissue paper.All in all, the hotel is certainly a nice place, and has the bonus of having three pc's in the business centre which you can access free internet but please, if you're coming here for peace and quiet then I'd choose another hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 9 2007 \\tWe loved the Hilton Garden Inn\\tWe booked our hotel in early November for a one night stay in early December. We used expedia and got a rate of $99 plus tax. The great thing is that parking is only $22 a night if you self park with no in/out privelages. The parking garage is attached to the hotel so it is convenient. We had a room with a king bed, microwave, mini-fridge, coffee maker, blow dryer and more. The room felt exceptionally clean. The bed was a therapeutic. The comforter was white and soft and you could tell it is kept clean. It felt like home, not the tacky, old multi-colored comforters/bedspreads many hotels use. The view was good. The staff was nice and helpful. There is a pool and jacuzzi tub on the 12 floor along with a business center. The pool is a bit small but very clean and the jacuzzi was wonderful. The hotel is in a great location with easy walking to the magnificant mile on Michiagn Ave and much more. There is a mini-starbucks store right in the lobby. The restaurant P.F. Changs is attached to the hotel along with a grill with a nice bar. I would go back to this hotel again, even if I didn't get the same great rate. It is tough to get that low of a parking rate at most hotels.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 11 2007 \\tVery Good Stay\\tI attended a convention the week of Nov. 6th. Before I made my reservation, I tried to obtain a room at one of the more exclusive hotels, but they were sold out due to several conventions scheduled that week. The Hilton Garden Inn was a very pleasant surprise. My room offered a good view of the cityline, good size and comfortable linens. I am very picky about my sleeping quarters, and this was very suitable and very clean. The bathroom was adequate. The service and staff was great! This was my first trip to Chicago and I wanted to experience the luxury's that Chicago offers. The hotel is in a great location and the Weber Grill located in the hotel had good steaks. Also, on the corner, I dined at PF Changs, which is always very good. Make sure you visit the Hancock Observatory and dine on the upper level for lunch, make sure you visit the restroom for the view. Also, you can't miss the Navy Pier. My favorite, of course, was the shopping on the Magnificent Mile! What an experience. Needless to say, I came with luggage weighing 24lbs and left with 46lbs and two carry on shopping bags.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Oct 14 2007 \\tNo luxury hotel - but good value for money\\tI stayed in this hotel for leisure for five days and was overall quite satisfied with my experience. The big advantage of this hotel is its location - it is very conveniently located in the near north area just two blocks away from MagMile and a few more from the Loop. It is also one of the more inexpensive hotels in this area and offers spotlessly clean rooms, free high-speed Internet access and comfortable beds. The service we received was efficient and faultless. Additionally, I found the hotel much more quiet than I expected from reading some of the reviews on Tripadvisor. All in all, I found it was a good base for exploring Chicago.What are the downsides? The rooms as well as the lobby are a bit on the small side by US-standards. The lobby and the adjacent Weber Grill Restaurant can become pretty crowded at times, especially during breakfast and dinner &quot;rush hours&quot;. The Starbucks in the lobby has very limited opening hours (actually it was closed most of the time when I fancied a hot drink) which is not a big problem as there are various grocery stores and cafes around the hotel. All in all, it is not really a luxurious place to stay but rather a hotel that offers above-average standard at reasonable prices.Would I stay there again? On a similar occasion, yes.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 2 2007\\tvery ordinary\\tThe hotel is in a great location, however the rooms and amenities are below expectations. The night I stayed their website price was $405 a night - I pricelined for about $90. The latter price was more than enough. The rooms are small. The staff are way less than three star. Take it from a seasoned traveler.... ok, but don't pay a lot for this.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Sep 14 2007 \\tFriendly staff lovely room fantastic location\\tI booked a room for myself and a friend through Hotwire and got a good deal on the room. At check-in the staff were friendly and helpful and the desk staff always had a friendly smile and greeting whenever we passed through reception regardless of what time of the day or night it was. The room had two queen-sized beds and we experienced no problems with house keeping, the bedroom and bathroom were immaculately clean every day. We had breakfast in the Weber Grill attached to the hotel on the first day and it was the only low point of the stay. The breakfast was cold (this was at 10am and breakfast sevice ended at 10.30 am) and expensive but the waiting staff were very nice and on another visit (this time for lunch) the food was very good. Most of the other guests were also quite young and there seemed to be a few bachelorette parties staying but even so it didn't seem too noisy. Overall, a fantastic hotel with an unbeatable location.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 27 2007 \\tFast response from House Keeping\\tWe were stuck at Chicago O'Hare on lay over as the airport shut down due to weather. We were very happy to be able to snag a room for the night, our rate was about $210. Since we arrived without our bags, at check in I asked for a basic toiletry kit. They said they would call housekeeping. Nada. I call housekeeping, they quickly brought toothpaste and brush for one, we needed 2, plus do they have a bathrobe? Another quick response and we had what we requested. I expected the hotel could provide an actual kit, with shaver, deodorant, comb, toothpaste/brush etc.Food: Call room service, no response. Try again, busy signal. Again, no response. Call front desk, they tried, no response. &quot;must be busy, try again later&quot;. We keep trying and finally after about 15 minutes we are connected with room service. Room delivery was speedy and the pizza was good along with the Mrs. Parks house cabernet.Bathroom: The shower curtain needed changing as it smelled moldy. As I showered, even though I was careful to get the curtain all right, I still flooded the floor. There were only 3 towels for the room and I hated to waste the &quot;spare&quot; on the floor to mop up the water. Water pressure was okay, plenty of hot water and there is a supply of soaps and lotions and shampoo.Room/bed: Nice layout with desk sitting area and then the flat panel TV. Comfy bed with a pillow top. Down comforter and pillows, soft sheets. Cozy for the weary traveler.Breakfast: No complimentary breakfast. Food was good and service great.Check out: Simple. Grab an airport shuttle at the front door and back to O'Hare.It looked like a nice location, the area was very clean, a nice area of the city. Obviously we didn't spend much time there.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " 'Aug 15 2007 \\tWish I had stayed longer\\tI only stayed here for one night in July but I wish it had been longer. The room was excellent with a king size bed and it was, without doubt, the comfiest bed I have ever slept in, even without using the possible adjustments. I did not want to get up in the morning! There was also the use of a fridge which is always a plus with me. It is nearby to shopping areas, including a very useful supermarket where I got an international phone card. The pool is small but at 10.30 pm I had it to myself. I went to the Weber Grill for breakfast where the staff were friendly and I got the most delicious pancakes, freshly made for me. I was sorry to leave so soon.\\t\\n',\n",

       " \"Aug 13 2007 \\tGreat Chicago location\\tWe picked this hotel based on the good reviews and also it's close proximity to the Magnificent Mile, boat cruise and other attractions. We were able to walk with small children to many of our destinations. Also the hotel is a short distance from one of the free trolley stops.As for the hotel itself: Check-in went very fast. Our clean room had two comfy queen beds that had tons of great pillows. We stayed on the 21st floor, so traffic noise wasn't a problem. The bathroom was a nice size and our room had a mini fridge, microwave, coffeemaker and high speed Internet access. The swimming pool was small, but it served the purpose. The hot tub was clean and the whole swimming pool area was in nice shape with lots of clean towels. Two floors of the hotel had wireless Internet access. On one side of the lobby is a Starbucks that was open in the morning hours and on the opposite side is the Weber Grill. We didn't go to either one, but the Weber Grill was packed for dinner, so they must be doing something right. The hotel has valet and self parking. The parking structure is connected to the building and has easy access to the hotel. Parking was $22.00 a day which was reasonable considering other hotels charge much more. My only complaint is that the concierge didn't know a thing about the free trolley service, so he wasn't much help to us.I'd stay at the Hilton Garden Inn again for the convenient location. At less then $200.00 a night, I thought it was a good deal for being in the heart of Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",

Good choice!We 've stayed here 3 nights and everything was really good.The hotel itself is clean, nicely decorated (nothing special, but just as you would expect from a Hilton/garden inn) and the location is really perfect! Downtown, close to the nicest stores, attractions, bus stops and restaurants; great!The staff is VERY friendly, the breakfast at the Weber Grill (which was free for us, as Hilton Honors members) is really nice and everything's freshly prepared to your order.

We had a few minor problems with housekeeping (but they were responsive and took care of it immediately) and the cooling unit--hard to maintain a steady temperature--but nothing serious (or we would have rated it lower).

Good buffet - nothing fancy - but a great way to start the day with made to order omelettes, pancakes, potatoes, french toast, bacon, sausage, pastries, etc.The hotel is definitely understaffed. There always seemed to be a line at the front desk regardless of the time of day. I needed to call on three separate occasions for a wake up call and was put on hold for over 5 minutes each time.The rooms are nothing fancy and seemed a bit small, but were clean and had comfortable beds.I have stayed at this hotel before and would stay again.\\t\\n',\n",

The staff was extremely helpful with transportation questions. The kids loved the small pool (which is to be expected in downtown Chicago).

There is a subway/metro entrance directly in front of the property if you need public transport, but not to be confused with EL or the Elevated Train, which could be loud in the evening. Great Stay and Drama Free..\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"May 8 2007 \\tWhat you need to know\\tGetting to this hotel from O'Hare by public transport is very easy but may not be ideal if you have a lot of luggage or a few kids. Hop on the blue line, switch at Jackson to the red line, get off at Grand and the hotel is at the top of the stairs, cost $2!! The journey takes about an hour. The red line also takes you to Wicked, get off at Randolph and Washington. We always found a queue at reception, the staff continuously stopped dealing with customers to answer the phone, maybe a telephonist would solve the Q problem. The room was a little gloomy but clean, the air con was one of those huge old boxes and was very very loud, nothing subtle about it at all. The traffic noise was considerable but in a downtown hotel that is to be expected. However this faded into insignifcance when compared with the constant mysterious droaning noise, the sort of noise that hurts your whole body and not just your ears. We hoped it would go but it didn't, we tracked it down to pipes lurking behind a door on the opposite side of the corridor, I asked for a different room. The hotel was fully booked and it would be midnight before the staff knew of cancellations, the receptionist promised to call before she went off duty to let us know if we could move, she didn't call, she promised to get us earplugs, they didn't arrive, she promised to leave a message for the next shift, someone was to call us at 7.30am, she didn't appear to leave the message and they didn't call. Finally after explaing the whole story again the following morning we were moved, a lower room, worse traffic noise but that was ok.............until the dripping started. I awoke in the early hours to hear water dripping onto the ceiling above the bed, it was very annoying, I left a note and a generous tip for housekeeping and asked that they report this problem. I returned from my day out to find it had not been resolved, the guy on reception said he would deal with it immediatley, I returned after Wicked went to bed and woke in the early hours with drip drip drip....So 3 sleepless nights in the Hilton Garden Inn.On the plus side, breakfast in the Weber Grill was good, very attentive staff and eggs, pancakes and omlettes made to order. Cosmopolitans at the bar were great.Out and about, exit front door and turn right, walk along a few blocks and you will come across a good Irish Bar, Fado. On this same street you will find a Rain Forest Cafe, a Hard Rock Cafe and the anniversary McDonalds, the poshest Mickey D's you will ever see and the only one I have ever been in where the food in real life is as good as the photographs. You will also find a stop for the Hop On Hop Off tour which was very good value but it's the luck of the draw when it comes to guides. We had Baron &quot;the sexiest tour guide on the planet even if he did say so himself&quot; he was interesting and funny, the next guy wasn't so hot. Good stops are the Navy Pier, a little quiet during our visit, the art museum which had more Monets than you could shake a stick at, the aquarium, fab penguins and of course Sears Tower, well organised and no real queues.We saw Wicked which was good but not great, Elphaba has a tremendous voice but lacked a bit of stage presence, Glinda saved the show. I should add that we watched Mary Poppins on Broadway the previous week, it was totally fabulous and perhaps this jaded our view of Wicked just a little bit. As noted in the prvious reviews, the Mag Mile and Nordstroms are a few steps away. Chicago is a beautiful city, for folk in Ireland, Aer Lingus do direct flights from Dublin, pop over for a few days, you won't regret it.Would I stay here again? Yes, if they could guarantee a good nights sleep. The location is superb and its good value for money\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 8 2007 \\tGreat Location Decent Property\\tThe best feature of this property is the location. It is only a few blocks off Michigan Avenue in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. A rail rapid transit station entrance (Grand Street Station on the Red Line subway) is right outside the door, which is convenient, especially if you are going to a baseball game as this line serves both U.S. Cellular Field (White Sox) and Wrigley Field (Cubs). The property itself is fine, but nothing special. It is a standard Hilton Garden Inn, which microwaves and refrigerators in each room. The rooms are smaller than the usual Hilton Garden Inn and also not as well furnished as most Hilton Garden Inns, but are very clean, if not quite spotless. Includes a fairly nice business center and small fitness room, with a small, but nice pool. As a bonus, hotel guests have complimentary access to a large, full service gym one block away. Instead of the usual, non-descript restaurant that is normally included in Hilton Garden Inns, the Weber Grill restaurant is on the first floor. The food here is extremely good and it includes a lively bar. Breakfast includes a reasonably priced buffet with numerous choices including outstanding bacon and pancakes. The only complaint is that the hotel feels crowded, as if the designers never thought it would sell out. The lobby is small and there are not really enough elevators to properly handle a full house, which is what I encountered the weekend I was there. Most significantly, the front desk was inadequately staffed, resulting in long lines. The staff themselves were very helpful and efficient; there simply were not enough of them to handle the volume of guests. Of course, Hilton Garden Inn is not a full service hotel brand, so a portion of this problem may be attributed to that fact. BOTTOM LINE: A good choice if it is price competitive.\\t\\n',\n",

The Red Line Grand el station sits on the property. It is one block from Michigan Ave located on the backside of Nordstroms. There are endless bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel. The Weber Grill bar is a great place to grab a drink and appetizer. Also, if you want a terrific breakfast, go to Snickers on the corner just a block north of restaurant/brewery across the street. Great little place....not fancy, great hashbrowns and eggs for a low price.\\t\\n\",\n",

The buses run one block over on Michigan Ave.There is a grocery store across the street. where you can buy a bus/train pass for $5.00 for 1 day. The hotel was very nice, clean. The beds were comfortable. The room had a microwave, mini fridge and internet connection. I called the hotel to make reservations because we wanted adjoining rooms. I didn't see any place on their website to make that request when booking two rooms. They said that they couldn't guarantee adjoining rooms. I called the morning of 4/6 and asked if they would be available. We were able to get two adjoining rooms with king size beds. We were happy! It helps to be flexible. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 13 2007 \\tFine but not the best\\tHave stayed here on several occasions before, and I have to say that this time round I was a little disappointed - nothing particular, but on previous stays I'd been put in rooms on the higher floors of the hotel and I remember them as more spacious and comfortable than the room I was given this time, on the 16th floor. Terrible soundproofing (which wasn't a problem last time I stayed) meant that I could hear everything from both rooms next door - the TV, people in the bathroom, etc etc. Also the room was a bit more 'tired' and less spacious than I remember. However couldn't complain too much - the price was good, it was perfectly clean and staff are helpful and friendly - it's efficient and in a great location. I just think that there might be better deals out there if you look around - however would be happy to stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 29 2007 \\tBuyer Beware\\tOn March 27th, I booked a 3 night stay in May at this property for$180.00 per night. I quickly realized that I had made a mistakeand the next day tried to add an additional day. On the internetat Hiltons website they allowed me to add an additional dayat $229.00 for each day of my stay. Most hotel companies willsay &quot;we're delighted that you've decided to stay an extra day with us,Hilton says &quot;this is our opportunity to rape you&quot;. I was upset enough that I canceled the entire reservation. Today, March 29thwe called this lovely property and were politely told there wasnothing they could do for us. Mind you, we have been HiltonHonor members since Julyt 1995.. I would be willing to take betson how many times you think I will stay at a Hilton property forthe rest of my life. There are too many hotel companies that really do care about their customers.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 27 2007 \\tgreat!\\tgreat hotel in the heart of the city, close to everything. excellent amenities (pool, jacuzzi, computer use etc) and good service. only drawback: the room decor is too 'flowery' (although beds are comfortable and bathroom well equipped).\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 24 2007 \\tvery nice\\tWe had two rooms for our family of six and while they were not connecting, we had no issues. The beds were comfortable and the hotel was quite. The location was great with tons of things within walking distance. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 16 2007 \\tNIce clean Hotel- great Location\\tStayed at the Hilton Garden Inn March 13-16, 2007. The hotel is in a great location, with Nordstroms 1 block over and Michigan Ave. 2 blocks. The Navy Pier is straight down Grand Ave. and a nice walk if the weather is nice- probably about 10 blocks. We got up and ran along Lake Michigan one morning. We were on the 21st floor at the Hotel. It was very quiet from street noise, however the doors slamming automatically in the halls are loud and annoying. The room has a small microwave, fridge, and are large. The beds are comfortable and firm. NOt the best I have slept on, but adequate. We used the small fitness room which had 2 really good ellipticals, and 3 lower quality treadmills. I also used the business center, which is free to surf the web and print out my airline boarding passes. We got a buy 2 nights get third night free special, which made the hotel very reasonable. The red line sub way is right outside the door and you can get to Lincoln Park area and Shopping on State very easy. A great seafood restaurant- Shaw's is down a block. Highly recommended! Buy your discount theater tickets on[----].overall, I would stay there again. The rooms were very clean and the staff was great! Did not eat at the Wevber Grill.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mar 12 2007 \\tGood Hotel\\tI stayed at HGI on 3/9 &amp; 3/10. Booked through Travelzoo for a great rate of $89.00 per night. It was very busy with basketball playoffs...not why I was there...so was glad I had booked far in advance. Great location, just a couple of blocks off Michigan Ave. Nice rooms, bathrooms etc. Would definately stay there again. Weber Grill restaurant that is attached is very nice. Try the artichoke dip appetizer and you will be very happy. Steaks are great too! Self park and get validated at the front deak when leaving saves you some money.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Mar 6 2007 \\tGreat location\\tThis hotel has a great location as others have stated. We used public transportation- the red line was at the door, and the bus a short walk away. We received a corner room xx32 on a high floor. We had two windows and a great view. The fitness room is nice, the pool is tiny- but I had it to myself at 6:30 am.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Feb 27 2007 \\tWorked for us\\tMy husband and I booked this last minute and went with the HGI based on price and location. It couldn't have been better for us. There is a red line stop just outside the front door, so it was very convienent to everything from the loop to the water tower and beyond.My only complaint was that they wanted $2 for a granola bar in the gift shop. Insanity. There is a Jewel/Osco grocery around the corner and a Trader Joes nearby, so I stocked up the fridge in our room with juice and snacks (I'm pregnant and must eat constantly).I know there is a pool and workout room but we didn't use it. I think this would be a great hotel for a family.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 26 2007 \\tHGI rocks ! Excellent stay \\tExcellent mid-level hotel at a very convenient location, and at a very good price for Chicago. Front desk service = Jessica and Diane, were superb! Super nice welcome and very helpful and efficient, handling all requests perfectly. Room was on 20th floor with nice view North of Hancock Tower, and was absolutely quiet, spotlessly clean, and comfortable. The nice amenities included complimentary high-speed in-room internet access, fridge, microwave (perfect for families), good-sized desk, lounge chair w/ottomon, Neutrogena bath products, as well as small pool &amp; hot tub and gym/exercise room. This hotel also offered a &quot;Business center&quot; with (3) computers, printers, and supplies of everything to do business, along with conference rooms on 12th floor...for all guests. The hotel is 2.5 short blocks from famous shopping at Michigan Avenue, and has the &quot;Weber Grill&quot; restaurant attached. We did not try the restaurant, but it seemed perfect for meat lovers... priced like a steakhouse too! Plenty of restaurants, clubs, bars in the area as well. Red Line subway station conveniently right outside front door.Only very minor minus: when the heat/AC unit turns on (like other HGI we've stayed at) seems noisy/loud at first, but got used to it. No problem sleeping.Yes, we'd stay here again .. without hesitation.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 20 2007 \\tLoved the HGI\\tBooked 3 rooms at the HGI this past weekend thru Travelzoo for 89$ back in November. It was a mom and kid's weekend and the hotel couldn't have been any nicer. We had requested an early check in which they accomodated and set us up in a corner of the 22nd floor all together.They rooms are fairly laarge with a microwave and fridge and Neutrogena products. Everyone at the desk was helpful for directions, transportation. The location was EXCELLENT. We walked everywhere and the Red line was right outside. The Navy Pier Trolley right up the street.I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it.Only drawbacks.....the hot tub was not filled the entire time we were theree and after a cold day would have been appreciated. Secondly, I would Not recommend the Webber Grill for breakfast...long lines at the buffet.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Feb 3 2007 \\tVeru nice great location..\\tWe found the Hilton Garden Inn to be very clean, fresh and updated, and the location cannot be beat. We got a great rate through the Hilton web site for $129 a night with our third night free. No breakfast is served but we did have a microwave and mini-frigerator. There is a restaurant located off the lobby, mainly barbque, but room service is offered, and numerous restaurants are within a block. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The indoor pool is nice but small. Nordstroms and Northbridge Shopping Mall are a very short block away, and Michigan Avenue, aka, the Magnificent Mile, is two very short blocks from the hotel door. Parking is availible, for a fee, of course, in a garage attached to the hotel and there is a heated circular driveway from which you may load and unload your car. Bell hops and valets are readily available, but in no way is their service pushed upon you. We would definately stay in this hotel again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jan 15 2007 \\tExcellent Stay! Great hotel\\tGreat location for a 3 day weekend in Chicago. Staff is friendly and helpful, rooms clean and comfortable. Located 2 easy blocks from Michigan, lots of great restaurants close by, 1/2 mile walk down State to Macy's (former Marshall Fields), the Red Line is steps from the front entrance, a Jewel grocery across the street, Trader Joe's also 2 blocks away....We really found the location and accomodations to be great! The front desk has a list of bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. We arrived at midnight and the front desk gave us several options for places to grab a bite at that late hour. We opted for Mother Hubbards (State and Hubbard). This sports bar definitely was a 'locals' only kind of find. Simple but good bar type food. Don't miss Volare, a really nice Italian restaurant one block east of Michigan on Grand. My recommendation is to share an appetizer (the rolled eggplant was exceptional!), pasta and meat course to get the best value and especially since servings are ample but not too large.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jan 13 2007 \\tLoved the Location!!\\tWe stayed in this hotel for Christmas, the hotel is great, great location, staff were so helpful. The Red train line is just outside the door and it is a $5 cab ride to the nearest blue line (which we used alot) which takes you to some great shopping malls. The breakfast was great as this was included in our room price, lovely buffet. I have to say I missed my proper meals of what I like my potatoes and veg and meat, which is very hard to get, was sick of fast food by the second day. We ate in the restaurant in the hotel a few times and it was ok. I ordered room service one nite, the chicken was cold and I ended up getting food poisoning, which kind of ruined the holiday. But over all I cannot complain about the hotel and I would recommend the store across the street Jewel for stocking up on food as there is a fridge and microwave in the room.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jan 7 2007 \\tAbsolutely Perfect!\\tWhat a location! We arrived, parked our car, and walked everywhere. It was such a breeze checking in, the staff was incredible, and only $93/night! We will definitely be coming back in the future.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jan 5 2007 \\tGreat experience\\tMy husband and I had go to Chicago on somewhat short notice ( to take care of a relative's estate). Since it was going to be a stressful trip, I didn't want to have to worry about the quality of the hotel. I found a reasonable price on Travelocity and booked our stay, and we weren't disappointed. We ended up extending our stay and were able to get an even better rate from the front desk than on the Hilton website.We didn't rent a car, and were able to get around easily (the metro stop is literally outside the hotel, as mentioned in another review). Having a small fridge and a microwave in the room allowed us to keep our food costs down. There's a Jewel/Osco a block away, and a Trader Joe's about two or three blocks away. Plenty of good restaurants in the area, too. The housekeeping staff took good care of our room and were friendly when we wanted to sleep in.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 2 2007 \\tWeekdn getaway with the kids\\tHad a great stay with our two kids over the week of Christmas. Price was right ($93 through Hilton website), location was great (Nordstrom's for the wife and daughter, ESPNZone for my son and me just around the corner) and the staff was efficient and friendly. There are probably a dozen restaurants withina one block radius.The exercise room wasn't huge but had three treadmills and some other machines. The pool was very small and overly-chlorinated but the kids loved it just the same.I would recommend this hotel if you can get a good price on it!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 2 2007\\tPerfect Location During A Perfect Weekend\\tI came home last night from a two night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. I found a very good price for the New Years Eve weekend at hotels.com. (later a better price of $89.00 per night became available on travelzoo, but I couldn't cancel by original reservation) The location was perfect. We parked in the attached self park garage - nobody at the front desk mentioned anything about parking validation, but I asked at check-out. It saved $11.00 per day. Make sure you ask!The room was very clean and spacious with a great view. There is a fridge and microwave which were very nice to have for our leftover meals that turned into a midnight snack. This may seem silly to some, but the I loved the toiletries they provide. Neutrogena products. I like knowing what I am using instead of mystery brands. The Weber Grill is on the first floor and made for a great lobby bar. We ate breakfast there one morning and were disappointed to see that it was a buffet for $12.00 each. We were hoping we could order steak and eggs. That's okay. The food was good - there was an omlete bar and you could order eggs cooked to your liking if the scrambled ones were not what you wanted. I appreciated the security at the hotel on New Years Eve. After 10pm you had to provide your room key and a picture ID before getting on the elevator. There were also strict rules regarding noise levels and multiple guests in rooms. We didn't have any issues, but it was nice to know that if it were a problem, something would be done. This was a perfect location for shopping, dining, drinking and fun. I'll be back!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dec 27 2006\\tSo Convenient to Everything!\\tWe stayed here for a Bears game and general sightseeing. With the Red line right outside the door, we were able to go everywhere we wanted very easily. The hotel is also located right across from a very nice Jewel food store. Great for sodas or snacks.Check in was a breeze and the employees very friendly. We had requested a king nonsmoking and a king smoking and both were ready for us. A nice security feature is you must use your room key to use the elevator.Our room was fairly large, especially for city standards and was spotless with very nice furniture. It also had a microwave and refridgerator along with a coffee pot. We had a view of the Hancock Building and the windows opened slightly for fresh air.It had a good size bath that was also spotless and nice toiletries including lotion and mouthwash which is not often given. Good water pressure and plenty of hot water.The beds were comfy and made up with double sheets which is a nice touch. Pillows were okay but of the foam variety and a little hard. Free internet is a nice feature but charges for local phone calls a little cheap in my opinion.The Weber Grill is located in the hotel and serves a wonderful breakfast buffet with great service.Overall a great stay and would definitely stay there again. Wonderful location just off Michigan Avenue and a nice clean, friendly atmosphere. What more could you ask for.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Dec 18 2006 \\tToo Good to be True\\tAnother great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. This was our 3rd time staying here in two years. We had adjoining rooms with my Mother, Wife and three kids. We paid $89.00 a nite. This rate was through travelzoo. The hotel is in a excellent location. The staff are the friendliest people. I have to say that about everyone we had contact with. You will find that people in Chicago in general are friendly(must be a midwest thing). We also will be returning in March.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Nov 28 2006 \\tANOTHER GREAT STAY...\\tThis is our third stay in two years at this hotel. Terrific location and nice sized rooms. Having a microwave and small frig in the room is a definite plus, particularly w/ a wonderful market right across the street for snacks. Not really a nice view from this hotel, but it's a good value and a short walk to Michigan Avenue. My only complaint is w/ the hallway doors. They SLAM shut , and I mean SLAM! You can hear everyone coming and going because they don't think to grab the door. Would definitely stay here again though -- and probably will next Thanksgiving when we go back up to Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 13 2006 \\tOutstanding in every way\\tFive college friends and I had a delightful stay. From the exceptional customer service (front desk, housekeeping, bellmen, etc.) to the large, clean, and comfortable rooms, we found the hotel to be outstanding in every way. From the 23rd floor, the view of the city was fantastic; street-side, the location on Grand and State was great -- just steps away from lively Michigan Ave. and all it has to offer. We were especially impressed at the hotel staff's willingness and abilitiy to honor our request for adjoining rooms -- one with two beds; the other a Murphy suite with a double bed, large sitting area with sofabed, plus a kitchenette. From our previous experience at other hotels we were not optimistic about the likelihood that we'd get what we requested when we made the reservation. But by calling the night before arrival, the front desk staff and housekeeping made sure we got what we asked for. We've stayed at the 5-star Omni on previous trips and found the 3-star Hilton Garden Inn to be superior in every way. We'll be back!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 24 2006 \\tSuch a relief!\\tMy Mom and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn, downtown Chicago this past August on a girls trip. We stayed for 4 nights. The hotel was very clean, the service was awesome, staff was eager to help with any questions we had, quiet rooms and comfy beds. The breakfast is the best downstairs! The pool was a little small (especially when there is 10 kids in it).Mom and I were in Chicago for the King Tut exhibit at the Field Mueseum. As the hotel is a hop skip and a jump from the Magnificent Mile, transit was super easy. We were originally booked into another hotel, but after reading it's review on this site, we switched, and we are so relieved we did.One more thing, Mom and I asked for a corkscrew from concierge. It got to our room super fast however it broke off in our bottle. Moral of the story? Don't ask the hotel for a corkscrew. They are pretty cheap.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Oct 12 2006 \\tVery Good Hotel\\tStayed for just three nights in September this year. The hotel is in a great location for just about everything. Good sized room with an OK view and everything was clean and well maintained. Staff across the board was very helpful. Weber Grill is great for breakfast ($12.95 for buffet) and also steaks. Highly recommended hotel.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 3 2006 \\tWe loved the location!\\tWe stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn in Chicago for 4 nights last fall. Average priced (for Chicago) parking was located on site. We parked our car and walked or took public transportation everywhere we needed to go.The check-in was quick, the lobby was attractive, and the room was a nice size, very clean, and suprisingly quiet. We had a very nice view out our window. We had an adequate sized refrigerator and microwave in the room, too.Directly across the street from the hotel (to the west) was a Jewel Supermarket where we bought breakfast foods and snack/sandwich foods to save some money on our trip.There is a Weber Grill restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel that has a fantastic buffet breakfast (we ate there on a Sunday morning...I don't know if it's an every-day thing or just weekends). Many, many, many other restaurants are located within walking distance. We walked to Gino's Pizza and Rainforest Cafe.If you want to take the subway, well, it's super-convenient, as the subway entrance is on the same corner as the hotel! We bought a multi-day pass and rode buses, subways, and El trains to all the tourist spots--John Hancock Building, Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, Shedd Aquarium, to name a few.Would also highly recommend &quot;Chicago Hauntings&quot; bus tour (can walk from hotel to tour embarkment) and Wendella's Lake and River tour (90 minutes)\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 12 2006 \\tGood Stay\\tWe had a nice 4-night stay at this hotel for a mini vacation during the last week of August. The location was convenient and we walked to many things. The room was fairly spacious, clean, everything was in good shape and we had an ok view. It was fairly well equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, iron, internet service, etc. One thing I forgot to check for when booking was an in-room safe, which they did not have. They did have safe deposit boxes at the front desk and that worked fine for us. We requested a high floor and they followed through by putting us on the top floor. The staff was wonderful. Over all we enjoyed our stay and would return. Our Sun-Wed stay got us a free night, so it was a great deal for this class hotel.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Sep 10 2006 \\tPaper Thin walls\\tThis hotel has paper thin walls and you can hear evrything in the rooms next door and in the halls. I have stayed at 1 star motells that are more private. Also i called the hotel direct for reservations, and then they transfered me to the central call center. i knew where the hotel was because of the Weber Grill in the lobby. The reservation center said that they had several downtown lockations and could not be sure that the one that they were reserving for me was the one that I had asked for with out an adress.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Sep 8 2006 \\tWorth every penny!\\tFirst I want to say that if it sounds a bit pricey to you, it definitely worths every penny. The location couldn't be more convenient, especially for a tourist in Chicago. In addition, we found the staff friendly and helpful, our room very nice, extremely clean and spacious. One of the best hotels I've ever stay, and will stay there again if I'm given the chance.\\t\\n\",\n",

It's noon and I wanted to check my bag because I scored a ticket to Wrigley on a Sunday. I'm standing in line for the desk when I spot two bellman walk onto the lobby. Tell the guy my situation and boom, claim ticket and down to the Red Line, off to see the Cubbies. Back to the hotel after 5pm and checkin not problem, in fact I think they pre assigned rooms, king non smoking. Same room design as my last stay, clean except for the drinking glasses. Microwave, mini fridge and comp pass to a real fitness gym one block away. Jewels grocery across the street. Rental car not needed as public transit is pretty fast. Did rent a car the last day to drive outside of downtown and returned by 5pm. Scored a parking meter one block away from the hotel, leaving by 7am, so free all night. Second stay in this city at this hotel. My third will be here too.\\t\\n\",\n",

What a great location right by the red line. You won't be disappointed with this hotel. Also, as info since I have not seem this before, visit the Federal Reserve Bank, its free and where else can you get so close to one million bucks and leave with $364 for free! Also, check out the Blue Man group show for a great time and guess what, its right off the red line at Belmont and a quick ride back to the hote!\\t\\n\",\n",

US Airways managed to lose our baggage so on arrival check in staff provided us with toothbrush, toothpaste etc which was a nice touch. I had asked for a corner room as had been recommended and was given one.Hotel has all that is required including a 24 shop selling essentials, a starbucks, a smallish pool and hot tub. There is a business centre on the 12th floor with 3 terminals all providing free internet access and printers. On one occasion the printers weren't working so the front desk did the online flight check in for me.There is a Weber Grill attached to the hotel which does a great buffet breakfast for $12.95 and great food in the evening. There was a wait time of about an hour the evening we ate there, but I called down, mentioned I was staying in the hotel and got a table pretty quickly.Location is great. Metro stop outside and Navy Pier free trolley just round the corner. Rooms were cleaned very well and even clothes on the bed folded. All in all for a 3 star hotel, it was superb. Many people, including Americans we met en route were suprised that we'd take a vacation in Chicago, but it was fantastic. Go!\\t\\n\",\n",

Great location, convenient to all of the wonderful Mag Mile shopping and the red line train. The wonderful staff were able to answer any question you might have about how to get around the City, etc. Housekeeping was efficient, polite and thorough.My only complaint - the mattresses are horrible! I'm generally not a picky person, but sleeping on a board took it's toll after 4-nights. Until this hotel replaces its mattresses, I probably won't come back!\\t\\n\",\n",

Why this hotel is not rated higher than 3 stars is beyond me!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 3 2006\\tExcellent Stay\\tWe enjoyed a four night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and could not have asked for more in a mid-range priced hotel. The staff was extraordinarily friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and had the fresh look of a new or recently renovated space. The bathroom had very good water pressure in the shower, generous counter space and plenty of towels of adequate size. I loved the convenience of the mini fridge. A microwave was provided as well. The closet and drawer space was adequate. While the comfort level of the beds could not compare with my pillow top mattress at home, the mattresses and pillows provided a reasonable level of comfort for a hotel. They were firm without being too hard. While we had some traffic noise even on the 19th floor, the sound proofing within the hotel is excellent and we didn't hear any noise from the other rooms or even the hallway. The location is ideal for tourists with a Jewell grocery store across the street, across from the Red Line subway stop and near bus stops and you're within easy walking distance of some of Chicago's best restaurants and the shops on Michigan Ave.. We bought 3 day visitor's passes for unlimited travel on the transit system which was really easy to get around on. To get to the Art Institute or the Museum Campus walk to Upper Michigan and Illinois and take bus no. 146. To get to Lincoln Park Zoo walk to Grand and LaSalle and take bus no. 156. If you're interested in the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright visiting Oak Park makes for a fun day out. Take the Red Line to the Lake/Clark exit and transfer to the Green Line and get off at the Harlem stop. All the sights are within easy walking distance. To get to Second City take bus no. 36 from Grand and State. The Starbucks kiosk in the lobby sells pastries and coffee and Cosi is a chain about a block or two east on Grand that sells a good cheap breakfast. Also Mary's which is 2 or 3 blocks away. The front desk can give your directions. All in all a great place to stay.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " 'Jun 16 2006 \\tDisappointing overpriced\\tI stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for 3 nights while traveling on business. The room rate of $359 per night was outrageous for an average to poor room with no amenities. The beds were not very comfortable, the pillows were flat, and the bedspreads were dirty. Yuck! It was a disappointing experience. Our room smelled like an overdose of air freshener and I had a sinus headache every morning.\\t\\n',\n",

The room was wonderful, a corner view, Room 2170, and clean and bright. I would recommend the hotel to anyone traveling to chicago. I was really having a hard time deciding but price was finally the deciding factor. I was pleasantly surprised to have everything, including location, be so wonderful. the hotel delivered a bottle of champagne and complimentary breakfast passes because it was our anniversary. The staff was pleasant, friendly and very helpful with all of our questions.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 5 2006\\tA Perfect Place for a Birthday\\tWe chose this hotel from the many available due to the comments made and the value offered. We were not disappointed in the least. From the check in to check out, everything was wonderful except for the last night when housekeeping missed us which we think was due to having a Do Not Disturb sign on the door till 10:00AM. One call asking for them to do the room at 5PM when we left for a baseball game was all we needed. We were very lucky to get the 2107, a beautiful corner room with a wonderful view. It was my 50th birthday and management sent up a bottle of champagne. What a lovely touch. This hotel has a great location. 2 blocks from the Magnificent Mile, kiddy corner from Nordstrom's, 2 blocks from the river, right in front of the subway to the baseball park! Very safe. We felt safer in downtown Chicago then most places we have ever been. The people are great, the number of excetional resturants in walking distance is amazing. Do try Osteria via Stato, just around the corner on State Street. $39.95 prix fix menu that is incredible and thus why it was named to the Bon Appetit magazine top 50 restauirants in the USA. Great value.Back to the hotel, the bed is very comfortable and the window opened althought the noise even on the 21st floor could be a little loud but it is a big city. We thought the room size was just right for 2 and would definately stay here again for its value, service and location. The full breakfast at Weber's downstairs and that came with the room had everything we needed. Bacon, sausages, scrambled eggs or made to order, french toast or made to order panckaes and omlettes. Fruit and a selection of breads rounded out the selction completed with fresh coffee and fresh juices. Had a great birthday and hope to come back soon!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 25 2006\\tDisappointing\\tThe motto du jour of presumably the entire Garden Inn chain is &quot;100% problem free&quot;. If only that were true! We were initially assigned a fully accessible room, although neither of us requires nor requested such an accomodation. For those not in the know, full accessibility features a cavernous washroom with double-wide door, an extra-tall toilet, has a curtained-off alcove lined with rungs of handrails in lieue of a bathtub, and displays an inconveniently-placed showerhead (think YMCA). This was, in fact, a &quot;problem&quot; for my soak-craving partner, so we immediately called to request a new room. In exchanging the keys we were relieved of our two coupons for free bottles of water from the ill-stocked and un-manned pantry beside the front desk. Upon arrival one floor up we noted that, contrary to our registration profile, we were directly between the elevators and the ice machine, and that this new room was also accessible (although not to the degree that the previous one had been). Tired from our flight, we endured the almost constant traffic outside our door and within the wall at the head of our bed where the elevators whirred and hummed until the next morning. We also had to unplug the noisy (and empty) bar fridge, which commenced emitting a sour smell. A second call to the front desk generated assurances that the bellboy would be up momentarily with keys to a third room. After 15 minutes a third call prompted the receptionist to inform us she would be delivering them personally. As we waited in the hall outside our room with all our baggage for a further 10 minutes we had to let ourselves back in to answer a call telling us they were now actually really truly on their way. Meeting us by the elevators we were assured that we had been moved to a corner room on the second-to-highest floor, far from the elevators and stairwells. It was, in fact, not a corner room, and was also directly across the hall from a stairwell. It did, however, have a normal bathroom and a better view. Over our short stay I noted that housekeeping did not thouroughly clean the tub and toilet, nor did they fully replenish the amenities on more than one occasion. The bedside table contained not only the requisite bible, but also a discarded porn magazine! Most troubling, though, was that this hotel does not offer room service, opting instead to rely on the services of third-party restaurants in the neighbourhood that close early, open late and specialize only in steak and pasta. As such, we requested cutlery and plates from the front desk to eat our carry-out of Indian food, but they simply never arrived... I wish we hadn't either.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Apr 21 2006\\tabsolutely fantastic!\\tMy wife and I stayed there on a &quot;fun&quot; trip from April 17-20,2006 and had a great time. The hotel room was clean and spacious with no unpleasant surprises. The staff was courteous and helpful at all times. We ate at the on-site Weber Grill upon arrival and had the best burger in our lives,complete with fries and cole slaw, all for $10.00 each. Most in hotel restaurants are priced out of our league but we were very satisfied and comfortable here. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot;, 5 blocks from Navy Pier and five minutes from bus service to the Museums (Bus 146-remember that!)We had plans to go somewhere else over Memorial Day but have decided to return to Chicago and the Hilton instead.....our stay was that great...\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Apr 10 2006 \\tOne of the better value-for-money deal\\tI was in Chicago for 2 weeks and stayed at HGI from 27/3-31/3. I've also stayed at two other 'inn'-type of hotels in Chicago downtown area as HGI was full during the busy Apr convention/conferences/exhibition/spring break month. For $139 pernight, I got a single rm with microwave, mini-fridge and the plus:free Internet connection! (most other places charges abt $10perday). The room was clean and bathroom was well-stocked. The Netrugena line of products was a nice touch. The staff was very nice and friendly as well.The location was ideal: a trip from Ohare airport to hotel costs only USD2 and the subway station is just right outside the entrance! It was convenient to get groceries with Jewell Osco opposite the hotel and not to mention the numerous eating places nearby. I was definitely spoilt for choices! :)I've been to other hotels and this is defnitely one of the better one (under $150 bracket-type) in Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Apr 6 2006\\tGreat Stay -- A few hiccups though\\tMy husband and I checked into the Hilton Garden Inn on 3/27/06 and stayed until 3/31/06 and we had a marvelous trip to the Chicago. We saw a taping of &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; (bizarre and sureal), went to see the musical &quot;Wicked&quot; at the Oriental Theater (highly recommended) and went to see the Black Hawks defeat the St. Louis Blues in overtime (!) at the United Center. We ate excellent meals at both Heaven on Seven and Redfish (see my seperate review for Redfish). We also ate at Mother Hubbards which seemed more like a drinking establishment and not a dinner place (I would not recommend the ostrich burger). The HGI was an excellent base for our stay and was within walking distance for virtually everything we did (although we did take an express bus to and from the hockey game which is highly recommended at $2.00 per person each way). The Sears Tower was quite a hike from the HGI but it was a lovely day so we did walk back AND forth (but hey it gave us license for eating a great dinner with no guilt)!After taking a cab from Union Station we checked into the HGI on Monday but our key card did not open the door properly and took many tries (typically 4) to get the door to open. This problem happened virtually each and every time we tried to get into our room. Frustrating yes, but we learned to laugh about it and took bets on how many times it would take! Once inside our room we instantly noticed there were no pillows -- bizarre but we phoned down to request some and we were told they were to be sent up. Later while unpacking we noticed there was not an iron, only an ironing board. When we went out to grocery/snack/wine shop at the Jewel-Osco store (how nice to have a full service grocery store so close by) across the street later that afternoon we asked the front desk to send us an iron and also mentioned the room was still without pillows. They apologized and assured us everything would be taken care of. When we returned 30 minutes later there was a knock on the door and an iron appeared but still NO pillows. It was only after a phone call from the front desk checking on the iron, that we reminded them that we still had no pillows. The pillows were then quickly dispatched. I hate to sound like a complainer as these were certainly minor issues but they seemed odd as a cleaning person would certainly notice the absence of pillows and probably notice the missing iron. By the way -- the rest of the week the cleaning service was excellent so this could have been just a strange occurrance.I would definately stay at the HGI again and the rate of $139 per night was VERY reasonable. We are not needy nor demanding people so the king bed non-smoking room we requested (and received) suited our needs just fine (really it was GREAT)! We also loved the business center where we could check our email, and I was able to get more info regarding the express bus to the United Center saving us tons of money on a cab. We also appreciated the mini-refrigerator but did not use the coffee maker nor the microwave. Unfortunately we were too lazy or too tired after some late nights -- that's our story and we are sticking too it -- to use the pool or the exercise center but they looked great. Also kudos for the blackout curtains at the HGI and they should be standard at every hotel as they overlap in the center so there is not a large ray of light streaming into the room each morning.All in all we had a FABULOUS trip to Chicago and the location and ammenities of the Hilton Garden Inn really allowed us to enjoy our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel and will certainly attempt to use it again when we return!!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mar 25 2006\\tGreta place to stay in Chicago Downtown!\\tI just returned from a stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. I booked this room based on the reviews posted on the trip advisor web site. I stayed 4 nights with my college-aged daughter and her friend. This hotel was exactly what I had hoped for. It was centrally located in downtown Chicago, directly across the street from the Grand Street EL station (red line-north). We purchased visitor passes and used the EL extensively. The desk staff was excellent! They gave us 2 bottled waters and a great room with a view. When we mentioned that we had reservations at PF Changs restaurant(at the end of the block), they gave us coupons for a free appetizer. Whenever we asked for directions to a certain loaction, the staff provided us a mapquest map to get to our destination. The price was excellent. All the rooms have a small fridge and microwave and there is access to a business center that has computer terminals and printers. I highly recommend this hotel as a GREAT place to stay in downtown Chicago.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Mar 23 2006\\tJust Ok I think Homewood Suites is a better Hilton choice\\tJust returned. The rooms are clean, small, and just OK. Housekeeping is a weak link. The first day of our stay we returned to the room about 4:30 and no housekeeping. We went downstairs to wait in the lobby. About 5:15 I asked at the front desk where I was told &quot;there is no daily housekeeping unless you call&quot;. That seemed impossible to believe, but I complied by asking for housekeeping every day. (The desk clerk said, &quot;You really want housekeeping every day?&quot;) We are not difficult people, but even a Motel 6 has daily housekeeping for heaven's sake. They then put &quot;a rush&quot; on our room, and 45 minutes later we had clean towels but no clean sheets. We paid $139 and for that price I gave it three stars. Any more than that would be inappropriate. Valet parking is $36 a day, but we needed the &quot;unlimited&quot; aspects of that service. Unfortunately, we forgot to factor that in for a &quot;written in stone&quot; Sunday morning obligation, and were almost late when it took the better part of an hour to get our car. We had called ahead, and the valet boys were too busy counting their tips to go and fetch our vehicle. Finally, one of them asked if we needed help and we said we had called for our car before we left the room. At that point, one of the boys actually stuffed the folding money back into his pocket and went to get our car. Upon leaving, we waited several minutes for the valet boys to pocket their tips before moving a car that made it impossible for us to exit. Not cool.As Hilton Honors members we thought we would receive preference for our request of a &quot;high floor&quot;. Not so. We were originally placed on the 13th floor, and it was only because I asked about a corner room that we were placed on the 19th floor. And there are 23 floors, so that wasn't a &quot;view&quot; room. True, we are only &quot;gold&quot; level not platinum. Even so, 2 bottles of waters seemed like a minimal acknowledgement of our Hilton loyalty. While we were there we walked 50 steps to another Hilton property, the Homewood Suites. I talked to a staff member there who was really open about the property where Honors Gold members are automatically assigned to the 12th floor which we verified as being completely non-smoking and comprised of actual two-room suites which had all the amenities of Hilton Garden(free hot breakfast) plus free cocktails/dinner in the evening Mon.-Thurs.. A better choice if you have the extra $50 a night considering you also get a kitchen and guest laundry. All in all, having stayed at many downtown hotels, Homewood Suites is the best Hilton choice. Embassy Suites down the block has a crowded noisy lobby, minimal room furnishings, and is the most expensive. Hilton Garden Inn while clean and modest, has paper-thin walls and no real acknowledgement of Honors benefits.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 21 2006\\tGreat Weekend\\tJust returned from a long weekend with my husband at the Hilton Garden Inn. We had a wondeful time - the room was very clean, location was great. The staff was very helpful in getting tickets for shows, and navigating the trains! Have stayed at the Westin and prefer this location better, close walk to the mile, and great restaurants. The red line and trolley to Navy Pier are just outside the front door. For the price, you can't beat the service or location! We can't wait to go back!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mar 15 2006\\tSuper!!!\\tOur family stayed for one night as a family weekend get away. The location was great. With a stroller and two young children the location of the hotel made it easy to get around. The free trolley service it right across the street and dropped us off right at the door to Navy Pier, and back again. We did use one of their free cribs, and being very picky thought it was good enough for my baby, although I did put my own sheet on it. We used the pool to entertain the kids, it did have a strange smell but was clean and fun. The bath tub actually could be filled to bath the kids after the pool.All of the staff was helpful and extremely nice. We are looking forward to staying here again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Mar 15 2006\\tLovely helpful cheerful staff at the Garden\\tWe spent two days mid-week here while visiting family. All the usual amenities were up to standard, but what we specially noticed was the cheerful and SO helpful staff, not so common downtown anywhere. The breakfasts were great too - continental was included in our stay, but for $1 each we could have `the works', including omeletttes and such cooked to order. This is the fifth Chicago hotel we've tried, and the first we've liked enough to want to come back to.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 4 2006\\tGreat location. Great price. Great service.\\tI stayed on a Friday night for a short weekend visit. I paid $100, so didn't know what to expect. I was plesantly surprised. The staff was nice. The room was very nice with a good view of the city. The pool and hot tub were enjoyable. The only negative is the parking situation, but that is true at almost all hotels in downtown Chicago. The location was close to everything. I would definitely stay at this hotel again over many more expensive places.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 27 2006\\tGreat!\\tVery good experience overall. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was nice--no complaints. The location is great. Check-out was very easy, didn't even have to stop by the front desk. I'd recommend it to anyone. Easy, no-hassle trip!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 27 2006\\tGreat value and location\\tStayed in August for two nights with my girlfriend to see some baseball games. This was our second visit to Chicago and since this place had received favorable reviews we gave it a shot, turned out to be a great choice.Location - Great area north of the river about 3 blocks west of Michigan Ave and next to State St. One HUGE bonus is the subway station right outside the door, which came in handy for going to the baseball game. With the El, a 10 minute walk to Michigan Ave and plenty of retail estabishments nearby, a car is not needed. The area felt safe to walk in both day and night.Room - This is an older tower hotel, so the rooms are small as to be expected but adequate for 2 people. Air circulation was good and the bedding and furnishings were fine. Staff - Despite a late arrival, our King N/S Upper Floor was confirmed. The front desk staff guy was great, pointed out Bijon's American Bistro a couple of blocks away for a late night dinner. Also, when we needed a bandaid, instead of pointing us to a drugstore, they just gave us some from their own cabinet. Housekeeping was efficient and the room was clean.Amenities - A delicous breakfast was had at Weber's. We did not go there for dinner or use pool/gym. Lobby is rather small and except for a small nook with snacks/toiletries there is not much else in the way of services. Weber's is their only restaurant.Price - rate through Hilton Website was $170 nt for a midweek stay. I am sure that a weekend rate is less and probably would include breakfast. As a HHonors member we got free bottled water which was nice in the warm weather. As I always say, there is no reason NOT to use the Hilton website and sign up for HHonors, the price is the same and the chances are much better that you won't get bumped or put in a crummy room if the place is full.This is a great place to stay if you are looking for quality, value and a good location. If you want more of a full service hotel with more luxuries then you may want one of the larger places directly on Michigan Ave.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 22 2006\\tAverage hotel\\tWe picked the coldest weekend of this year to visit Chicago. Lucky us. My husband and I took our 7 year old to Chicago for some sightseeing and fun. His favorite part of the weekend was, of course, the pool. The pool was very small. Five families filled the pool and made it very crowded. The hot tub was very very hot. I enjoy hot tubs but this water was just too hot. I was scared for the small children who did go in it. Everyone you saw came out with very red skin. The location of this hotel is nice. Espn Zone is in it's backyard which is nice for 7 year old boys. We had a nice time but the Hilton didn't overly thrill us.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 20 2006\\tThis will be our Chicago home from now on!\\tFeb. 17-18: I took a girls trip with two friends. I am a Chicago native that wanted to show my 'Frisco friends what a great city Chicago is. From start to finish, the Hilton was the BEST! First, after arriving at 10 am from Midway (EL Orange line txf to Red line at Roosevelt to Grand stop - FYI - the EL drops you off RIGHT IN FRONT of the hotel), we thought we'd drop off our luggage and shop until we could check-in (3 pm). To our surprise and delight, the desk said that our room was ready THEN! As a Hilton Honors member, we were also given vouchers for 2 bottles of water (or one large) and $5 to use towards their pantry (snacks and stuff). Also included was breakfast for the 3 of us (Weber Grill is inside the hotel). It included a continental at the Weber, a Venti &amp; Pastry at the Starbucks (also in the Hotel), or, for $1 more, a Deluxe breakfast with made to order omelettes and pancakes. So off we went after a rest to see Chicago! At 10:30 that eve, we were looking for a restaurant for a late dinner, and the desk had an extensive list (with pricing) and even called ahead to check on seating and hours. We had a wonderful meal (GREAT STAFF AS WELL) at the recommended Volare (201 E. Grand). The rooms were clean, the staff was not just accomodating, they went above and beyond (too many times to mention here!). STAY HERE - you won't regret it! BTW: 137.33/night at the Hilton website.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Feb 8 2006 \\tGreat location; great staff; great price\\tGreat price, consistently helpful, friendly staff, very clean and nice, small touches everwhere. I had a corner room w/ two windows, a microwave. refrigerator, easy chair and a very nice closet and bathroom for $130 night. Of course, it was February so I assume that price is seasonal. I would pay quite a bit more to stay there regardless. Near Nordstroms, a small grocery store &amp; other retail that comes in handy. Also free use of Crunch gym almost next door (as well as a nice hotel gym). The Weber Grill restaurant had a reasonably priced breakfast buffet with excellent service and nice &quot;to go&quot; options. A very well run hotel. I wish there were more like it. Will definitely stay there again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jan 30 2006\\tGreat hotel\\tI stayed here between Christmas and New Years and the hotel staff was amazing. My frequent flier account wasn't attached to my HHonors account and the rep at check in insisted she take care of it and then followed up with a call saying it was done. The room was immaculate, modern (bed not the most comfy)and the heating worked well. The fridge and microwave were very clean. Kudos to the business center, they have a color printer available for guest use and the remote printing feature from your room is great and secure! Location is great being next door to PF changs and a short walk to Nordstrom on Michigan Ave.\\t\\n\",\n",

I prepaid my stay through [--------] and for just $89 + tax got a great room. Like other reviewers with hhonors membership, I was given a voucher for a more than adequate continental breakfast, free vouchers for bottled water and other goods from the 24hour pantry. Service was excellent throughout. Location is pretty quiet for Chicago, a reasonable walk to just about everything but with a red line subway station right outside the door. For me at least, a much better choice than previous stays in and around the Loop. Overall, highly recommended.\\t\\n',\n",

It's in a great location a couple of blocks from the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave) and within walking distance of The Loop. We even walked to Soldier Field and back but you might want to hop on a bus or the subway which has a stop almost right outside the door. The hotel was everything we hoped it would be - rooms were nice and clean and the staff were friendly. We had a great view of the John Hancock Center from our corner room (other rooms have the possibility of views of the top of Sears Tower). The attached Webber Grill offered a breakfast buffet every morning for a reasonable price, which was very convenient. I'd definitely stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 27 2005\\tFar above the crowd\\tI stayed at this hotel twice in December 2005. The front desk staff was very friendly and genuinely concerned with the quality of my hotel stay each time.(One clerk even said &quot;Welcome home!&quot;) Being a Hilton Gold member, I was given a top-floor room, vouchers for breakfast, Starbucks coupons, bottled water coupon, and a $5 coupon to the gift/snack shop. The room was nicely proportioned with a comfortable bed, mini-bar with a microwave, and a desk with complementary Internet service. The bathroom was moderate in size, very clean, and well-lit. Overall, the hotel floor was quiet and orderly. I found a parking spot on the street so I didn't have to pay for parking (after 6pm on Saturday, the parking was free at the meters I found right across from the hotel entrance).The breakfast vouchers were for continental breakfast at the Weber Grill, but one can upgrade to a full breakfast for a dollar (total $9.95 if paying without a voucher). I found the food and atmosphere to be appetizing and inviting. This is a steal in Chicago for an unlimited breakfast buffet. I must reiterate that the staff of this hotel make it stand far above its competitors. I have stayed at other hotels with more &quot;stars&quot;, but the HGI Chicago Downtown deserves more than 2.5 for the superior &quot;can do&quot; attitude of its staff and its vast array of guest services.\\t\\n\",\n",

Right in the heart of shopping a couple blocks from North Michigan Avenue. A short walk to the stores on State and the theater district. Right around the corner from the hotel is a grocery store! Perfect!The lobby has a modern, minimal look. There is a high priced mini convienent store right off the front desk. A starbucks in the lobby, with very pleasant employees. I won this hotel on Priceline it's labeled as a 2.5 star. It's way better than that. Whether you win this hotel in a bid or purchase it, you can't loose.

One exception: the dust ruffle on the bed was torn all the way around. Why that would be I don't know. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean. Room was a tad small but ok for us. The staff was exceptionally friendly. They moved us to a higher floor on check-in when they heard that our relatives were up there. Housecleaning crew didn't clean our room till after 4 pm on Friday. There is no breakfast buffet but there is a corner bakery down the street with great breakfast choices. One suggestion: you may want to choose another place to eat besides the hotel's weber grill restaurant. Chicago has so many great places to eat. We didn't eat there but my relatives said the Weber grill is expensive and the food just ok.\\t\\n\",\n",

This saved us quite a bit of money, being able to eat breakfast and a light dinner/snack in the room.I loved the location, too. There's a subway stop right outside the doorway of the hotel. We parked our car at the hotel ($21/night, no in-out privleges), bought 2-day CTA visitor passes for $9 each and used combinations of subways, els, and buses to get around Chicago. Two nights we ate dinner at restaurants within walking distance of the hotel (there are LOTS of restaurants nearby!). We ate breakfast in our room 2 mornings, but on Saturday morning we ate downstairs at the Weber Grill. They had an excellent and very reasonably priced breakfast buffet.

The bar is very friendly and having Starbucks morning coffee available in the lobby is spot on.The pool is very small and workout area adequate, but you can go next door to the &quot;Crunch&quot; Gym if so inclined.The location of this hotel is second to none. Slap in the middle of town, a block from Mich. Ave with everything else in walking distance. Staff are very friendly and helpful, my only complaint is that the room service seemed very sparse on a Friday and my room still had not be cleaned by 3pm, however this was the only time.Would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are a single female in town...I felt very safe.\\t\\n',\n",

The Hilton Garden Inn is ideally located right near State Street and about a three minute walk to Michigan Avenue. You're steps from great shopping, beautiful architecture and everything you could possibly want. I went with my newly-appointed fiancee to celebrate our engagement. We took a cab to the hotel - it was about $50 on account of a lot of traffic. Next time, I would definitely take the EL (we took it going to O'hare upon departing Chicago and it was really easy). Check in to the hotel was quick and efficient. We had a corner room on the 22nd floor with a northern view out of one window, and an eastern view out of the other - both of them of the Chicago skyline. Room was clean and beds were comfortable (we opted for two queen beds because we are engaged, not married, so I can assure you there was no hanky panky - just kidding, we opted for the king and I can assure you the springs are broken). All in all, it was a pleasant stay and there were zero problems. Other points worth noting: The homeless in Chicago are very friendly. Rush Street has some great bars. For breakfast we walked along Rush heading north about 10 minutes to Einsetin Brothers Bagels (worth the walk). Spend an afternoon at Navy Pier. It's beautiful there. Take the EL going back to O'hare (or Midway) - the hotel will give you directions and everybody takes it so you won't be alone. Be careful of Chicago's famous deep-dish pizza.

I was staying there for a wedding a few weekends ago and had a blast.Location: It is very centrally located and the advantage it has from it's rival hotels located on the Mag. Mile is that it is not crazy busy when you step out of the front door. The Mag. Mile is less than a 2 min. walk away. Several times, when my wife and I went shopping, we were able to run back to the Hilton and drop off our bags. We also had a couple of nice morning runs down to the Navy Pier and got to see the Air Show practice one of the mornings. Staff: People were very helpful and willing to help. The young, tall African gentleman at the door was helpful with my bags when I arrived and equally as helpful when we left. We must've asked about 50 questions to the front desk on recommendations for late night bars/clubs/eats and they accomodated each one. Rooms: Room was very clean and we did enjoy having the mini-fridge in the room w/ microwave for all of the left over food we had after eating out!We stayed in 2205, second floor from the top and had a great view of the Chicago skyline, including the John Hancock Tower.I will post pics soon. I would definitely stay there again next time I go! I just have to let my arteries clear of the stuffed pizza courtesy of Giordano's!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 28 2005\\texcellent hotel\\tWe stayed three nights after booking a good deal on the Hilton website. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We definitely appreciated having a fridge and microwave in the room. The room was clean and comfortable. Ours was on the 18th floor and we had a view of the top of the Sears Tower and the cityscape. For the money it is a great hotel. Clean, comfortable, friendly, affordable and in a good location. I would definitely recommend it to others and stay there again.We also took a tour wich they recommend us was great . We are planning another trip to chicago and we ll stay for sure at the hiltons\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 10 2005\\tNice stay at the Hilton Garden\\tWe stayed three nights in early August after booking a good deal on the Hilton website. We were able to walk to Michigan Ave. and the Art Institute without any difficulties. (We found a shortcut through Nordstrom's to Michigan. The store is very close to the hotel, just walk through and you come right out on Michigan. It saves a little time and walking.)The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We definitely appreciated having a fridge and microwave in the room. There are two restaurants onsite: Weber Grill and P.F. Changs. Both will provide room service for a small fee. There is also a Starbucks kiosk in the lobby in the morning.The room was clean and comfortable. Ours was on the 18th floor and we had a view of the top of the Sears Tower and the cityscape.My only &quot;complaint&quot;: The pool is nice, but very small. The elevators can also be very slow at times.Overall, for the money it is a great hotel. Clean, comfortable, friendly, affordable and in a good location. I would definitely recommend it to others and stay there again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 19 2005\\tFantastic Staff\\tMy friends and I recently went on a two week holiday in the states and visited New York, Vegas and finally Chicago where we stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn.I had a mixed experience with the hotels in New York and Vegas, however, found the Hilton Garden Inn to be fantastic. The staff were very helpful from the moment we arrived until we checked out. We stayed for three days and I was overwhelmed by the friendliess we recieved. The Webber Grill is a great restaurant with good old American sized porrtions and a large selection to choose from. Also the hotel bar had informal and friendly staff who were up for a laugh and once again couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome.The Hotel is located beside the magnificent mile and is therefore great for this who love to shop etc etc. Also there are plenty of bars / restaurants nearby for socialising and late night drinking!! I use Trip Advisor to help me book hotels and have never before written a review. I must say that the staff here were by far the best I have ever experienced. Everything from booking restaurants to recommending good nightlife to arranging travel to and from baseball games was all part of the service provided the guys at the Hilton.Definitely recommend it if you want a centrally located, Clean, modern and friendly hotel experience in the heart of Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jul 11 2005\\tNice hotel. Great Location\\tHotel was clean and in good condition. Staff was extremely helpful and was very good at giving us different restaurant ideas.

Not spectacular rooms, but very nice.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 30 2005 \\tGreat hotel great location\\tI was very pleased with this hotel from the moment I walked through the doors. Every hotel employee was very friendly and the service was very good. The room was large, very clean and well appointed. There was a refrigerator, microwave and free high-speed internet access. The blanket was sandwiched between two sets of sheet, which was a nice touch. Also, while the hotel was full I found that at most I had to wait a minute for one of the elevators, a fact I really appreciated. The location is excellent - within two blocks of the magnificent mile, half mile from navy pier, mile from the Art Institute, near public transportation and surrounded by restaurants. The area also felt very safe even late at night. The only area that could use minor improvements was house-keeping. The last afternoon I was there I was changing to go out aroud 4:30 and house-keeping walked in without knocking as they had left some cleaning supplies in the room. They were very apologetic and mentioned that they would be right back with clean towels. When I returned at 7:30 there were still no towels and it dawned on me that there had been no new towels the evening before, we had had extras in the room and used them. I called the front desk - they were very apologetic, said they had had a problems with the linen service and that they would be right up with them. A colleague also had the same problem and found it necessary to call the desk. On a minor note I had made coffee the first morning and it wasn't replaced until the 4th day, and the sugar and stirrers were not replaced. If not for these house-keeping issues I would have rated this hotel with five stars.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 13 2005\\tGreat hotel downtown\\tStayed there 5/31/05-6/03. Location is excellent and close to Mag. Mile and Museum, Art Institute, Aquarium, and Planetarium. All are within walking distanceThe staff was very accomodating and allowed us to check in early and leave our luggage on check out to do some shopping.The breakfast buffet was terrific, but could use more fresh fruits. The only mild downer was the in-room air conditioner which was occasionally noisy at night.Would definitely stay there again and I'd give it a solid 3-3 1/2 stars.Galoha\\t\\n\",\n",

The Webber Grill is pretty pricey, but there are plenty of other places around there to eat at. I definitely would stay there again!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Apr 27 2005\\tGood central location\\tThis hotel is great if you need a cheaper option that is centrally located. The beds are nothing to write home about, but the room is clean, and the front desk is extremely helpful. The location cannot be beat - it's close to everything. I have also stayed at the Talbot and I definitely would rather be here. The service and location is better. They accomodated my every request. It is not a romantic hotel in style, but my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 17 2005\\tGreat hotel. Loved it and would return\\tGreat value and centrally located for restaurants. Stayed here 3 nights after Easter. Saved $20 per night with Honors Membership. You'll get a free pass to Crunch which is a very nice private fitness club. Lobby connects to Weber's Grill which has great food. Michigan Ave is only a few blocks away. Had more fun shopping at the smaller shops on the side streets.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 9 2005\\tWhat a great place to stay!\\tMy husband, son (11), daughter (9) and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for three nights in March, 2005. What a great experience we had! The room was clean, the staff was extremely friendly and the location couldn't be beat. We got the internet rate of $109 which was a deal. It was great having a small refrigerator in the room for drinks (microwave too, although we didn't use it) . There's a great grocery store just across the street. The kids enjoyed swimming in the indoor pool--despite it's small size, it was perfect for them. We ate dinner at the Weber Grill and it was teriffic. Not one complaint about this hotel; I would highly recommend it to anyone!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 6 2005\\tWonderful stay!\\tWe just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Chicago. It was fantastic. The staff was wonderful from the moment we checked in until we left...this included the valet at the door, the porter, the front desk staff and the maids. Everyone was friendly and went out of their way to make us feel at home. The room was average size and very clean. We were in room 2203 on the Hilton Honors floor (the hotel has 23 floors). Our room was far from the elevator and very quiet. We had a view of the Sears Tower...which our boys loved. Our 8 and 9 year old boys swam in the pool (indoors). The pool is a &quot;play&quot;pool and only 4 feet deep and not huge. It was never crowded and they had a great time. The spa held 5 people max. Although not used the workout room looked nice. We opted for self park since we knew we wouldn't be using our car- this is $21 per 24/hrs and does NOT offer in/out privlages. The valet parking has unlimited in/out privlages and is $35/day. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay there again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 23 2005\\tBeautiful friendly secure...\\tI work at a Hilton Garden Inn in another city and was not disappointed by the quality of this hotel, by any means. The guest service and valet staff was friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating.Our guest room was incredibly clean, at a comfortable temperature and even had a decent view, for being surrounded by high rises. We bugged the front desk staff multiple times for directions, locations of attractions, recommendations, etc. Every time they were just as happy to help as if it were our first question.Our do not disturb sign was on from check in to check out and we were not disturbed once! In my experience with past stays at other hotels throughout the years, a do not disturb sign still means we can be bothered about towels and such. It was a pleasure to have the room all to ourselves.Our stay was the weekend before St. Patrick's day. The parade was happening as well as the green coloring of the river. The elevators were only accessible by key card. It was nice to have such security with a hard-partying crowd outside! The hotel is connected with a P.F. Chang's and another great restaurant; the name escapes me-they make grills, though. These restaurants will deliver to your room, if you like!! There's nothing like Chang's chicken lettuce wraps and mago iced tea in your pajamas!!If you get the chance, I highly recommend the Hilton Garden Inn Downtown Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mar 23 2005\\tGreat Weekend At The Hilton Garden Inn\\tJust spent a super three- day weekend at the Hilton Garden Inn. Got a great rate of $109.00 from the Hilton web-site. Not super fancy but very clean, new appearance. Staff were all very helpful and pleasant. Did breakfast each morning at The Webber Grill. Great location. Lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Took the free trolley to Navy Pier. This DuPage County kid and friends are already planning our next get away to Chicago and will definitely stay here again.\\t\\n',\n",

       " 'Mar 16 2005\\tVery pleasant hotel great value and great location\\tI stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for 4 days after Christmas. I got a fabulous deal (less than $90 night: tax included). It was clean, quiet, a good size and a fabulous location. While it is not the height of luxury, it is comfortable and the surroundings are very pleasant. I literally could find no fault with the hotel. I would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Mar 9 2005\\tregal hotel\\tThe Hilton is a regal grand hotel. We stayed on the excutive floor. The room was a little small but a nice view of the park at a resonable price. Some freebee's are the beautiful Botanical Gardens, Lincoln Park Zoo, and Buckingham Fountain. Downtown offers an array of dinning. We ate at Fridays which was within walking distance to our hotel. Navy Pier is a must, but you'll want to find parking on the street. Second City is great for laughs at a reasonable price. The Shed Aquarium, although a little pricey is a Must see. For those romatics take a carriage ride around the city for about $30. There are lots of other great musems to visit too.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 24 2005\\tVery Enjoyable Stay\\tHave just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and will definately be staying here again.The location was superb ; 2 blocks from Michigan Avenue and surrounded by a large range of restaurants and shops. The staff were extremely pleasant and friendly at all times and the whole hotel seems brand new and clean. The free internet access from all rooms is a huge bonus,as is the fridge in the room. The only small problem we had was that you had to run the hot tap for about 5 minutes until the hot water came for the shower.But I think this was more to do with the location of our room at the end of a long corridor with no adjoining rooms.I'd highly recommend this hotel for anyone on a Chicago break: and I'm usually a very fussy hotel guest!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 6 2005\\tVery comfortable\\tThough this place doesn't have the charm of some of the older hotels in Chicago, it is very clean and comfortable. The best part is the pool on the 12th floor. If there aren't a bunch of frat boys in the hot tub, you might actually get a chance to relax and gaze out the fully windowed walls for the great view. We paid $96 for the room (2 double beds), but I wouldn't go much more than that. Not that it's not nice, but you can get a room in the Knickerbocker for that much. This just feels like most other Holiday Inn type places.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 24 2004\\tIf you get a good rate this hotel is hard to beat!\\tI stayed at this property Nov. 11-13. The hotel was very nice and very clean. The Weber grill downstairs has a great breakfast menu and a good atmosphere at night. The location is perfect. 1/2 a block from ESPNZONE, Hard Rock Cafe, Rain Forest Cafe, Michigan Ave. My room was on the 15th floor and had a great view if the Sears Tower. I booked the room through Hilton's website and received a rate of $115 per night. I will stay at this property next time I am in CHI-TOWN...\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nov 4 2004\\tWould definitely stay here again\\tWe stayed here for 3 nights in july. The room was very clean, spacious and had an amazing view. The staff were friendly and very helpful, we were shown to our room by a member of staff to check that we thought there was enough room for the rollaway beds that we required. There was plenty of room for the rollaway beds and they were brought up straight away. There was free internet access, a small pool, hot pool and small gym all of which we made good use of. The hotel is in a great location right outside of the El. We would definitely stay here again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Oct 9 2004\\tGreat Hotel Fabulous Staff\\tWe enjoyed our four day stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. The room was neat and provided a lot of extras including microwave, refrigerator,etc.- for a reasonable price compared to other hotels. A wonderful location located a block away from Michigan Avenue without the noise. The continental breakfast that we paid for extra was worth it and having Starbucks in the hotel was also nice. The staff was excellent and if you want to make reservations, have them do it- they will get you in! We will stay there again on our next visit.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Sep 22 2004\\tGreat Stay at the Hilton Garden\\tVery pleased with our three day stay at Hilton Garden. Staff extremely courteous, check-in took less than a minute. Both the room and bathroom were very clean. Room was not huge, just nice size with king bed, work table, sofa chair and ottoman. Room was quiet, only occasionally disturbed by noisy people in hallway and passing fire truck 20 floors down. Location is hard to beat; two blocks from Michigan Ave. Tons of good restaurants within a few blocks, not to mention the Weber Grill in the same building. Only minor complaint would be noisy fridge, but turning the fridge down from max to medium setting took care of the issue. Since I would not rate this hotel as &quot;luxury&quot;, I would have hard time paying the $290 flat rate per night. If you can get the room at a discount like I did, it's defintely the top choice. Valet parking a little pricey if you are staying more than two nights, you can save a few bucks with self park.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 16 2004 \\tgreat staff!\\tWe stayed at this hotel with two small children while my husband was in town for a trade show. We've stayed at many downtown hotels and I have to say that I've never experienced such a wonderful staff! The valet guys, the bellmen, the front desk and even housekeeping were not only helpful in every way, but went out of their way to be friendly and available. They treated our children like honored guests! The hotel is clean, new and updated and has a good location - but the staff is what makes it an excellent choice.\\t\\n\",\n",

I stayed here for a trade show for two nights and was extremely pleased my entire trip. The location is walking distance or a $5 cab ride to anywhere downtown. Feel free to ask any employee anything about the city or the hotel because they all seemed competent as well as eager to help.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Sep 7 2004\\tnice and clean\\tWe stayed at the Chicago Hilton Garden Inn over the Labor Day weekend and were delighted. It is very clean, not tired and worn out, but seems bright and new. The one special thing I liked was a top sheet on top of the blanket. I very much appreciated not having to touch that blanket. It also had all of the amenities e.g. microwave, refrigerator, hair dryer, computer connections, etc. The room was not especially large, but we spent relatively little time in the room - only to sleep. We would definitely stay here again.\\t\\n',\n",

An overall GREAT value. We definitely recommend it!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 6 2004\\tMy choice for Chicago\\tSome friends and I went to Chicago last month. We knew we wanted to be near Michigan Avenue, so we chose the Hilton Garden Inn. A bargain at $109 a night, whereas most of the other hotels we saw were much more expensive. It turned out to be great. The room is nothing fancy, but certainly nice and it was very clean (microwave in room is a nice extra). However, the drawing card is the location. It can't be beat. Within walking distance are many shops, restaurants, pubs, a blues bar, and a piano bar. We were all very pleased with our choice and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great place to stay without breaking the bank.\\t\\n\",\n",

There is a supermarket in front of the hotel and you can buy all you need. There is a fridge in the room and a microwave, always helpful.

We fell asleep looking at the Sears Tower. The room was very clean and the service was excellent. The concierges on duty was extremely helpful giving us directions and tips when we needed them. One concierge gave us an entire itinerary for a night in Boystown (a great bistro and then some great clubs to go to).

I had little hard time finding the building entrance at night, the door connecting through the m-mart was closed, so I had to drag my bags and walk around the building. After then, I enjoyed walking down the street and looking at the boats. Once you cross the bridge, you can walk to the Chicago theater, ABC 7, department stores, borders bookstore and coffee shops. I had to use UPS and FEDEX service, they were very close and friendly. 2. hotel.It was just average. the room was clean and the view was great looking down the river. but the overall facilities were average.3. restaurant.I had dinner at the restaurant ordered the soba noodle salad and lobster main dish. but the noodle was overcooked, salad was right from a package, and the lobster was okay but not impressed with the risotto.\\t\\n',\n",

We had earlier stayed at a hotel close the the Magnificent Mile, so we wanted to try something different &amp; slightly cheaper. We were pleasently surprised. The hotel was in a highrise over an office building, therefore it had some great views. It was a very nice hotel and a great room, but it all starts on the 14th Floor, so be advised you need to take a lift to check in first of all. Great views of the city and river and easy walking distance to many sites. We love to get out &amp; about walking so it was in a good location, plus we didn't fear for our safety . Taxis were always close at hand.We had a couple drinks at the Skyline Bar on our last night and it also has a fantastic view of Chicago skyline - really beautiful at night &amp; what a great way to remember our last night in Chicago. We decided to stay there and eat, just ask the waitress for the restaurant menu rather than the limited bar snacks/menu. Beer prices in the bar we felt were actually quite resonable, considering the view you have &amp; we had paid more for a beer at a basic restaurant. All in all, we'd stay there again.\\t\\n\",\n",

Minimal noise could be heard from rooms around us but the cleaning staff VERY loud outside our room for an extended period as they prepared each morning to clean rooms.

       " \"Oct 8 2009\\tIncredible View\\tWe haven't stayed at this hotel for almost 20 years and the change is unbelievable. The view from the bar at night was hypnotizing and the rooms were great. We were able to request pillows that suited our sleeping style and that was amazing.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 7 2009 \\tNice hotel with great views\\tWe stayed here as we were on a weekend getaway. Had a spectacular view of the skyline and river. We were on the 22nd floor and had a corner suite so had views all around. Staff was friendly and helpful. Had a couple drinks at the Skyline Bar and it also has great views of Chicago skyline exceptionally beautiful at night. Prices in the bar were actually a little cheaper than some of the bars we went to. $9 for a martini is not that terribly bad. I would recommend the Snicker martini! Overall, had a great weekend and got to see a lot of the city and what it has to offer. P.S. We also got engaged this weekend on top of the Sears Tower!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 27 2009 \\tGreat View Nice Room\\tI was impressed with the view and the room. The wireless internet signal is weak in some places, but I eventually got it working (it could be better). There is a nice lounge/bar in the hotel, and it's within walking distance of several shops and places to eat. It's easy to get to a train from the Merchandise Mart by way of the hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 25 2009 \\tGreat price \\tWe booked over the phone after looking at pictures online. Never been to Chicago before and didn't know what to expect. We booked directly with the Hotel and got a great price because mom is a senior citizen. Staff was friendly and efficent. They even loaned us a wheelchair for mom! The view over the river was amazing! Taxis were always close at hand and we were close to just about everything we wanted to do. VERY PLEASED with this place and would stay again. Rooms are basic and double beds were smallish (full sized) but we weren't in them long! :) Tolietries were great, Bath and Body works brand. They had a nice bar in the Hotel too. Restuarant as well.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 17 2009 \\tinconvenient\\tWe stayed 2 nights at this hotel in August. When we pulled up in front of the &quot;hotel&quot;, we realized we were pulling up in front of an office building. The hotel starts on the 14th floor. So...if you want to run in and check in but leave older teenagers in the car until you get a room key...impossible to do. The option to unload luggage at the front door is fine IF you feel comfortable leaving a family member with it while you park in the lot and then walk up 2 flights of stairs, or you can park and drag your luggage up the steps yourself (which is what we did), then take the elevator to the 14th floor to the hotel, then take a different elevator to your room, or you can park all the way at the bottom of the garage and take a hallway to an elevator (handicapped route) which I chose not to do because of the time of night we arrived. All this to say that it was just very inconvenient. The pluses were: The front desk staff, and information desk people were very friendly, and the view from our room was fantastic. Our room was just O.K, cleanish, but we had to call maintenance since our toilet wouldn't flush. Evidentally someone before us had flushed a bar of soap. The restaurant that we went to was a bad experience. As the waiter was putting my child's plate down, half the food slid off onto the table. The waiter acted as if nothing had happened, did not offer to get a new meal, did not appologize, nothing. I should have asked for a replacement, but it was very late, we'd been driving for 16 hours, and so my son just ate the food that hadn't fallen off. After we paid, and walked away, and I guess after discovering that I hadn't tipped him, the waiter began yelling and cussing that this was 'the second time....&quot; This was actually a bit scary especially to my children. This hotel is NOT conveniently located to anything touristy. I think a lot of business people stay here because of it's location to the Plaza mart or whatever it is called. However, there are taxis that line up in front of the building, so not difficult to get anywhere.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 12 2009 \\tWOW! Great people great service great view great experience!\\tThe people rock! The bellman who greet you are so very, very friendly and helpful! The concierges helped us tremendously...we loved Christopher! We had issues with getting Sears tower tickets from the Sears tower group and he was &quot;on it&quot; from the start. He was relentless in his pursuit of our happiness and kept following the issue until even after we checked out. The people taking reservations were very personable, the waiter in the restaurant was right on top of it and even the housekeeper was very nice, very professional and very pleasant. Alls I can say was WOW...great job!!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 11 2009 \\tAverage stay. Bland Hotel.\\tI must admit this was not my 1st choice. Unfortunately, when you use the &quot;name your own price&quot; option on Priceline, you do not know where you're staying until after they accept your bid. I am accustomed to having breakfast included as well as a business center where you can access the internet for free (For example Hampton Inn), but that was not the case here. I refused to pay the exorbitant prices at the restaurant. The fitness room was OK. The location was also good, as I was able to walk everywhere. The bathtub in my room was peeling. If I had not waited until the last moment to book a hotel room, I probably would have stayed elsewhere. If you cannot find a room at another hotel, then you can try this place. Otherwise you might do better somewhere else. Overall, it was OK, nothing special.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 3 2009 \\tFantastic view!\\tThe best part of this hotel is the view. It sits on TOP of the Chicago Sun Times building, with the huge lobby on the 15th floor. Our room was on the 23rd floor overlooking the Chicago river &amp; everything on it ~ Breathtaking! I feel bad for the reviewer who said she had a view of a wall ~ that WOULD be awful! The beautiful Merchandise Mart was next door by way of a pedestian walkway, as was the train station, which was SO convenient for us! The room was lovely &amp; clean with comfy beds (most important!) We were also able to take advantage of the view from the CityScape bar on the lobby level, complete with free appetizers! My only complaint would be the VERY EXPENSIVE breakfast menu in the hotel's restaurant ($14 for french toast(!) &amp; $2.50 for a cup of coffee) I believe it was the same as the room service menu in the room.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 3 2009 \\tGreat Hotel. Great Value\\tMy wife and I were going to Chicago to see Jersey Boys and needed a hotel for one Saturday night. The Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza was a great choice. It was a great location, near the theatre and with awesome views of the river and the city. The hotel was very clean, obviously recently renovated, and had a very helpful and friendly staff. We also got a great price on Hotwire. Parking is not cheap ($31/night) but that is hardly unusual in Chicago. I would highly recommend this hotel.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 26 2009 \\tGood hotel - Would stay here again.\\tWe stayed at the Holiday Inn Chicago - Mart Plaza for two nights at the end of June 2009. It was a little bit nicer than the typical Holiday Inn, especially the lobby. The room was a little small, but fine for 3. The entire hotel was very clean. The beds were okay, but the pillows were great, and we got a &quot;pillow menu&quot; in case we needed different types of pillows. The hotel occupies the top 9 floors above the Chicago Sun Times building, and we were on the 21st floor. We were on the back side of the hotel and had a great view of the Hancock tower just to our right.The service we received in this hotel was wonderful. James checked us in and he couldn't be nicer. The concierge (Robert? Richard?) was so welcoming. He answered all of our questions and had information about how to get places, what to see and where to eat (we never made it to the restaurants he recommended, though, as there was a McDonald's on almost every block and my husband is not very adventurous when it comes to food).I did not use the exercise room, but it looked well-appointed. The pool was a little bit chilly, but not too bad.The hotel is in a great location. We had a 15 minute walk to Michigan Ave. in one direction and a 15 minute walk from the Sears (Willis) tower in another. We walked almost everywhere (we took a water taxi a few times), and didn't fear for our safety (except from the crazy cab drivers that were EVERYWHERE). The hotel is right next to the Merchandise Mart which has a lot of very high end home decorating shops and some restaurants and snack shops.Parking was $31 a night and although we didn't check in until 5 on Tuesday, we were able to leave the car there for a full 48 hours, which allowed us to do some sight seeing for a few hours after we checked out on Wednesday (Wendella offers a great architectural boat tour). We are priority/preffered members (free to join), so we got a coupon at check-in that gave us the choice of 15% off a meal at the restaurant or $5 a day off of parking. We chose the $$ off of parking.The only negative thoughts I have about this hotel were 1) it seemed rather small for the price, but I guess that's to be expected in a large city such as Chicago, 2) the hotel restaurant was a bit pricey ($11.95 for a continental breakfast???), and 3) the water temperature in the shower fluctuated so much that I spent more time adjusting the temp than I did actually showering.I will stay at this hotel again the next time we visit Chicago. Instead of driving, though, I would find a cheap flight. That way we would avoid having to pay to park, and having to drive in city traffic or on any of the freeways near the city. The cabs are so plentiful, and the public transportation there is so great, you wouldn't need a car at all!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 24 2009 \\tGreat Location Great Property\\tI enjoyed the room on the top floor. It provided two sides of views. The staff was courteous and friendly. The elevators were responsive, including the set that take you from street level to the hotel lobby. The hotel is conveniently located close to CTA stops so you can take the train from O'Hare to downtown. The bar adjacent to the lobby provides a similar view to the photo I attached. This was my first time at this property; it will likely not be my last. A great place to stay.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 22 2009 \\tBeautiful renovation awesome location- would stay again in a heartbeat!\\tWe were very impressed with our stay and will definitely return on other trips. The hotel has incredibly helpful staff, from the doorman to the concierge to the manager! We were in a newly renovated &quot;room with a view&quot; on the 23rd floor and I was very impressed. There is an overall modern &amp; hip feeling our room as well as the hotel's lobby &amp; restaurant areas. The bathroom &amp; room updates have been done very well. The shower was a generous size and there was nice storage in the sink/vanity area. The room was HUGE! We had 2 double beds and ample room for a desk and an armchair with an ottoman. We had 4 people in the room and did not feel uncomfortable in the least. The beds &amp; linens were clean, inviting and comfortable. I can't vouch for rooms that have not been renovated yet though so if you are booking, I highly recommend asking for an updated room. My only issues with the entire stay were:-very chilly pool temperature-reaching the hotel lobby required you to walk through the building lobby and then take an elevator to the 15th floor which was awkward when laden down with luggage and tired kids-if you chose to park your car and handle your luggage yourself, there were many many stairs to climb to reach the building lobby from the parking lotIn the grand scheme of things, my issues were negligible. Very nice stay!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 20 2009 \\tYou're paying for location and a clean room.\\tThis hotel is floor 14-24 of the Sun-Times building. You have to take an elevator to floor 15 to the hotel lobby, and then go through the lobby to get on another elevator to get to your hotel room. Youll get your fair share of exercise here. They have porters and concierge service. The lobby is new and has kind of an Asian flare. The restaurant, bar and lobby are all together on the same floor, and have an open air type forum, which makes for good people watching. The bar has an amazing view of the city, and outside of daily specials, you pay for it. The servers, and wait staff were exceptional.Our room was small but not stuffy. Our view was excellent, as we were upgraded for being Priority Club members, upon request. Be sure to ask for a room with a view, as some rooms have no view. Our room was outdated but clean. No funny smells, no rust stains, no torn carpet, etc. The only downsides were no vent in the restroom, and no mini-fridge. Some of the other rooms have been updated with modern furnishing and flat panel TVs, etc. Amenities included soap, shampoo/conditioner, lotion, coffee, tea bags (only on the first day, no more for 4 more days). Housekeeping was spotty, and they forgot to replace our amenities half of our stay.Room service is offered (costly), but many of the local restaurants deliver. Your food options are limited after 9pm as you are in the business district. There is a nice deli on the ground floor of the building that makes fresh sandwiches, salads, soups, and also sells sundry goods, but they close around 8pm or earlier. The building next door (Luxe Home, known as the Mart Plaza Building) has a McDonalds, Au bon Pain, Garretts Popcorn, and another restaurant on the second floor, not sure of their hours. There is a literal hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant about 3 blocks away called Eat, Drink, they have virtually no place to sit, but they sell good cheap Chinese food, and they deliver too.We walked outside after dark every night and never felt unsafe. We walked as many as 7 blocks in every direction and didnt feel uneasy at all. Most of downtown is well-lit, but Id avoid any dark looking areas just to be safe. Simply put, the larger the group you have, the safer you are.In conclusion, this hotel would rent for $65/night if it was in Louisville, but because its in downtown Chicago, its about $200/night. Youre paying for a clean room, spotty housekeeping and an awesome location.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Jul 12 2009 \\tChic design great location great views it's a Holiday Inn!\\tI spent 3 nights here on business trip. I have to say, this hotel has a really cool design and is located in the heart of everything in Chicago. It only took me 10 minutes to walk to the Sears Tower (which is now called the Willis Tower, in case you didn't know) and I would guess about 2 miles to Lake Michigan. (If you are in Chicago , do not miss the Buckingham Fountains. Quite a sight to behold with the skyscrapers in the background). It's hard to believe that it is a Holiday Inn in one of the most beautiful city in the US. The service was quite friendly from bellhop to front desk to restaurant staff. The coolest thing about this hotel is that the lobby is on the 15th floor. The CityScape Bar has magnificent views of the city and the modern design ItaliAsia restaurant whose asian/italian fusion menu I really enjoyed. I highly recommend this to anyone who will be in Chicago for business or leisure (shopping or sightseeing). Magnificent mile was within walking distance. I felt secure exploring the city and walking back to the hotel at 8pm.\\t\\n\",\n",

It wasn't the Ritz, but it was very nice.It's in the Chicago Sun Time's Building, across from the merchandise mart. A ways away from the hustle and bustle of Chicago, but it gave us some exercise. There is a McDonalds and Duncan Donuts in the merchandise mart, if you don't want to pay big bucks for just a muffin for breakfast.The staff was great, rooms were clean and housekeeping was usually early (only one day when I returned to the room at 4pm and it wasn't clean).\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 10 2009 \\tCouldn't have had a nicer time. Highly recommended.\\tWe couldn't have had a nicer time at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza. My husband, daughter, and I live in Chicago but stayed there for the weekend of our wedding anniversary just to be closer to the downtown attractions and play tourist in our own town. The staff was SO sweet and so very friendly. --As nice as any of the 4 star hotels I've stayed in. I just can't stress that enough. --Just lovely people.The rooms are nice, very clean, decently appointed but nothing too fancy. The indoor pool area was great, again very clean, lots of towels. Room service was super fast and accurate. The food in the on-site restaurant was delicious and served in a very upscale manner.It's close to everything, easy access to all sorts of transportation, beautiful views of the skyline if you're on the river side, big rooms, lots to do.I'd happily stay there again. We had a great time.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 9 2009 \\tGreat Hotel to relax with excellent location\\tWe stayed in HI MP during the back end of May 2009, while spending half term with my other half. Chose Chicago on the experience of a one day business trip back in 2005 and thought it would be good for a long city break. I must say we were not disappointed, it is a great city with lots to do and see and the food and people make the break a real pleasure.The hotel has a reasonable gym with good indoor pool. The bar is a great place to have a cocktail before you go out and has great views at night.We chose the hotel after reading the reviews on TR and we were not disappointed. When we arrived we were UG to a corner room over looking the river and the Hancock Tower, great view particularly at night. The room was big, like a suite, with King Bed and sofa that could pull down for a bed if required. Additional to a desk we had a table and chairs to eat our breakfast off. There is a CVS round the corner to get all that you need for the simple breakfast, if you do not want a &quot;full size&quot; from the hotel. The room had coffee making facilities and a fridge, so that was a bonus also.The hotel is located in a great place as you can walk along Wacker or stroll through the back streets to the mag mile. There are a number of good places to eat in the locality of the hotel. We ate at Lou Malnati's - 439 N. Wells, which was a great rec from TR and the Pizza was to die for, we also ate at Heaven on Seven, which again was a rec from TR, and the food was again excellent.We caught the El from ORD to Clarke and walked to the hotel, this was about 10 mins at the most. The brown line does stop at MP and you could get this from Clarke if you did not want to walk. At $23 I can recommend the 7 day CTA ticket, we used it all the time to get around on the El and on the bus up to Lincoln Park.I could go on and on, but hey you have to find something out for yourself!!!Use the site, people are really helpful and give really good advice.Enjoy Chicago, it is a great City and if you are not sure where to stay go to the Holiday Inn at MP, the staff will welcome you and you will have a good time and it is really quiet.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 26 2009 \\tGreat Hotel for Business or Leisure!\\tThis hotel was lovely! We stayed for three nights on the 23rd floor in May. The weather was about 85 degrees so it was lovely to take a break from sightseeing to relax in the quiet pool in the afternoon whilst it was too hot outside! The view from our window was wonderful - got the Chicago skyline looking North with the John Hancock Centre. If you are on the other side you can see Sears Tower! The hotel bar has great skyline views too so you don't miss out if your room doesn't have them. Good access to The Loop and easy to get around from here as its only a 20 minute walk or so to Lake Michigan and Navy Pier.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 19 2009 \\tGreat Hotel in Great Location\\tThoroughly enjoyed staying at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. Our room was fine and the view of the Chicago River the best. The hotel is atop the Mart Plaza, adjacent to the Merchandise Mart and the Brown Line train stop. Easy to get to anywhere via trains and a short cab ride to anything downtown or lake front. Excellent base camp for exploring the Loop, Lakefront, Museums, Architecture Tours.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'May 8 2009 \\tWould Stay again in a heartBeat\\tI used to travel to Chicago on a regular basis. I stayed on Michigan Ave. and it was noisy all night long. This hotel has lobby on 15th floor so it is up from the hustle and bustle, river runs on side or front so there is not heavy traffic. Was close enough to Michigan ave. that could walk and was able to walk or take short cab ride to most locations downtown. Breakfeast buffet good but has gone up quite a bit. Always clean.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Apr 27 2009 \\tNice Hotel not a super busy location\\tI stayed at this hotel this past weekend and it was a great location for me. On previous trips I have stayed right on Michigan Avenue and that gets to be a bit crazy with all the weekend tourist! This trip I wanted to spend more time on State Street and Rush Street and this location was perfect for me. I was in walking distance of everything (including Mich Ave) or a short cab ride away. The hotel itself was under going renovations, we had a nice new updated room. The bathrrom was very big with a nice shower. The room itself was specious with two double beds and a flat screen TV. The bed was comfortable, however I would have preferred a queen as opposed to the double. You enter the building at ground level and take the elevator up to the 15th floor. The lobby, bar and restaurant are located here. Check in was very easy, the staff was very friendly and nice. The bar had a nice view of the city and the drinks were delivered very promptly. I would stay here again, but request a king or two queens.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Apr 16 2009 \\tNice view rennovation nearly complete\\tHoliday Inns can kind of be a crap shoot, but this one was much better than your typical Holiday Inn. My room had a nice view and was large, with a comfortable bed. Earlier reviewers found it difficult to find....but I had no problem (the lobby is on the 15th floor, but there is a doorman on the 1st floor who directs you to the elevator). The business center was closed when I was there, but they let me use a computer &amp; printer in the office.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Apr 2 2009 \\tSecond Stay - Renovation almost complete!\\tSecond stay here, this time two nights, enjoying the flat screen television, cozy duvets on the beds and the four pillows to luxuriate in. The lure of Earth Hour brought us back this particular weekend. The renovation is almost complete and the lobby area looks fabulous. Unfortunately, the new restaurant was opening the day after my stay, but we enjoyed the great breakfast via room service one morning and the temporary location the next. Just as in my previous review, the restaurant staff is amazing. Everyone is so pleasant, helpful and genuinely happy to be working in their hotel. Dined in Cityscape Friday night and fell completely in love with Tony Miu's Zentini, a wicked combination of Skyy Citrus, Zen Green Tea Liqueur and lime juice, followed by an equally wicked Grand Pandaro Cheese Pasta, all while watching the beautiful night skyline along the river.Earlier in the day we had watched the Chicago Police boats going back and forth past Wolf Point and the river tour boats have already started service. Wish it had been warmer so we could have enjoyed some outdoor activity too.This trip we got to the gym and were very impressed with the equipment available. Everything was spotlessly clean to begin with and there were wipes and sprays available to clean the equipment before and after use, which gives great peace of mind. There's stacks of fresh clean towels and a convenient spot to drop the soiled towels, so everything stays invitingly clean, unlike many gyms.There is also a very nice sauna in the same area, but we hadn't thought to bring swimwear this trip, so no pool - no sauna. Next time for certain!Cityscape was a verrrry popular spot for Earth Hour so alas, we thought we'd have a better view from our room. We settled in front of the expanse of windows and watched as the lights went off in many downtown landmarks. It was gratifying to see how many people became involved in the energy saving movement, including, of course, the hotel who even doused the parking lot lighting. Once again, a completely enjoyable stay.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 29 2009 \\tWould have been perfect had we NOT had the WORST view in Chicago\\tI have stayed at this hotel three other times and each time we had a view that was absolutely unbelievable! On these other trips, we were never told that there was an additional charge for a room that faced OUTSIDE. But, this time, that was the case. So, we were in room 1855, which looked out at a WALL. It didn't seem like the hotel was very full so I don't understand putting guests in rooms with awful views - the staff should be showcasing the marvelous views, which are an important feature of the hotel.The room was ample and the bedding was nice. Housekeeping did a fantastic job and when we returned in the evening, the room looked as good as the first day we moved in. But - one day housekeeping didn't come at all. When I mentioned this to the manager, he was indifferent. The front desk staff is a little unfriendly and robotic as compared to other hotels in which I have stayed.All in all, had we not had to look at a wall, I would have been much happier about our stay.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 24 2009 \\tIt did the job\\tI should note that the date of the reservation and subsequent stay was in December, so some of the details may be a bit blurry, but much of the memory is still there.We arrived a bit before checkin, but the early check in was not a problem for the desk clerk. She quickly found the reservation and sent us up to our room, which was on the 22nd floor as I recall. When I called in the reservation, I remember talking with an operator who tried to talk me out of getting the room with a view; she said that just about all of the rooms have a wonderful view and that it probably wouldn't be necessary to pay extra for that feature. Somehow, though, I read &quot;room with a view&quot; to be &quot;corner room&quot;. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed it was not. Don't get me wrong, the view was still great (see the photo with this review), but I don't think it was anything for which I needed to pay extra. The room was clean and seemed a bit roomier than most hotel rooms in which I am accustomed to staying. Housekeeping did a great job every day. Everything looked great. It is a standard hotel room; I mean it's clean, had a great view, and you're in Chicago, so how much time will you actually be spending in your room?Pool seemed a bit cool, as others have noted. It also was a bit too crowded for my liking, so I didn't get to enjoy it too much. Again, as others noted, the food prices looked quite a bit too high to justify eating in the hotel, but again, you're going to be in Chicago. Get outside of the hotel. Do go to the bar at least once during your stay; the view is absolutely magnificent. I could justify drink prices that were a bit higher for that view--right at the fork of the Chicago River.The open air courtyard was nice. It was relaxing and the open feel was nice to see when leaving the room. I was quite tempted to get some of those little plastic soldiers with parachutes and drop a bunch of them to see them fall down to the courtyard, but thankfully, was talked out of it.The hotel is accessible via enclosed walkways all the way from the brown line station (Merchandise Mart). Some previous reviews I read noted that the walkway wasn't open on the weekends. I didn't find that to be the case, but it seemed as though there was a special event going on that weekend, so I'm not sure if that was a fluke or a new rule.Finally, I gave 5/5 for value. Since the stay I'm reviewing in Dec. 2008, it appears as though the hotel has raised it rates and substantially. If I'd paid the current amount for the room, I'd probably give it a 4/5 for value. The location is right near the heart of Chicago, yet far enough away that you're not awakened by sirens and/or traffic and/or trains. You'd be hard pressed to find a better location in Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mar 20 2009 \\tVery Good Stay\\tWe were very happy with our stay. There are significant renovations going on, but they appear to be nearing completion and they were limited to the lobby area and did not interfere with our stay in any way. The location is awesome, linked to Merchandise Mart (by an enclosed bridge) where there is a stop on the brown line subway. Lots of restaurant options within walking distance or by train. We did not swim in the pool but it was very pretty. The view from the room was very nice with city lights. However, we stayed on the west side of the buliding facing away from the lake and city, and I think the view would be even better from the east side. The truly amazing thing about this place is the value. The public rate on the room was pretty reasonable for being in the city. The amazing thing is the AAA discount which was over 40%. I am already a AAA member, but even if I was not, I would have saved over $100 on our three night stay even after incurring the cost of joining AAA. The only negative thing I can say is that the room was decorated a bit on the plain side, but it was spotless and perfectly acceptable. There is parking, but it was expensive as it is with most hotels in the city.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Mar 2 2009\\tThey could have told me this place was under total renovation.\\tI booked my stay here over the phone. I had stayed here before, and it was great. Not this time, though. The lobby is in shambles. The ceiling is gone, wires hanging down, the fumes of fresh paint, &quot;Beware of dust&quot; signs plastered all over the lobby. Horrible stuff. I got to the front counter, and asked what the deal was, and accomplished nothing. I just kept finding myself asking why it was not possible to tell me that they were undergoing absolute and complete renovation over the phone while I was booking my stay. The room was no better. Green paint, a 1976ish theme, and just a general plainness. I also couldn't get any internet, which is a huge problem for me. The only redeeming quality was a fairly good view of chicago, and a canal just below my window.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 27 2009 \\tStill under renovation traffic noise not what I hoped for.\\tBased on its amazing views of the river and downtown, I selected the Holiday Inn for a four night business trip. The first night's rate was very reasonable, but nights #2-4 were nearly double. Other comments about the difficulty in finding the hotel are well founded; the signage is inadequate. Exiting the elevator on the 15th floor, where the hotel begins, one is met with NO signs or personnel, just some construction work in progress. Turning the corner, though, and you can find your own way to the reception. At that point you realise that the HI signature dining room beneath the atrium is not there, or at least it isn't finished, so meals are served in two other locations. The bar overlooking the city is very pleasant, though you should check carefully what you order, and not assume you'll be given a promotion/cut-price drink unless you explicitly ask for it. The rooms are adequate in terms of amenities, and the exercise room/indoor pool really quite nice. But the major drawbacks are - apart from the dining issues - the constant rumble/occasional roar from the trains etc. below the hotel, and the workers who began their hammering at 6:50 am. To make the most of its location, the hotel needs a signifcant upgrade on its double/triple glazing, and either it should close while construction is underway, or it should warn the guests and require its building workers to hold off until, say, 8 am. Personally, I was disappointed, and I checked out by 8:30 am, finding another Chicago hotel for the same price that was drastically better on every level except the absence of a pool. By the way, don't use the internet facility in the rooms - they have obsolete software, and many major sites (including, ironically, orbitz.com) can't be accessed. When I complained about this, I was refunded the cost, but other than that there was only a half-hearted apology from the front desk. I expect they're weary about the current situation too, but when you have the choices Chicago can offer, this is a recipe for customer disenchantment and longterm disaffection.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 4 2009 \\tIt'll be great when the reno is done\\tThe Holiday Inn has a great location (on the north side of the Chicago River, steps from the Loop) but it is confusing to access on foot from the west. Renovations were going on in the lobby, presumably to modernize it (i.e. remove the dark repeating floral patterns). I expect that they'll be doing the same to the guest rooms, which look dated. However, the views are outstanding, at least from the 21st floor. The room was fine, but the bed could have been a bit more comfortable. Also, the bathroom vanity is triangle shaped and faces a corner with two mirrors. You can see yourself fine in them together, but what you think is your left hand is really your right, making for a fun time shaving! It's a small thing, but those are what get you.There is a skybridge from the hotel/office building to the Merchandise Mart and the el station, so you don't have to walk far outside if you don't want to. After checking out and leaving the hotel, I realized I had left my suit jacket in the room. Housekeeping was nice enough to hold on to it for me until I could return to get it.Overall, it was a good stay. This hotel will be near perfect once the renovations are complete.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 20 2009 \\tGood location. Okay Hotel\\tNice clean rooms. COLD pool. There is NO WAY this was a heated pool. Weren't able to utilize it and this was one reason for wanting to stay here.Hotel was near public transit, which made it convenient to get around.Staff was friendly.Restaurant had good food. No free continental breakfast served though.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 18 2009 \\tIt was your typical holiday inn - just fine\\tWe ran a conference here in November and stayed 2 nights. I got upgraded to a corner suite which was great to start off with, then you find out in the corner suites on that side of the building the rooms don't reach the free internet signal. Bedroom: Large corner suite, good layout. Ok bed, not the Westin or anything.Bathroom: just okWe did our event in the Wolf Point ballroom, which was gorgeous with full windows on 2 sides. Typical Holiday Inn banquet food, however great banquet service which exceeded my expectations.Restaurant: just okLocation: Could've been better it was a long 30 minute walk to get across to the bridge to anything decent. Great view though!Conceirge: WOW - he was excellent - wonderful maps &amp; service. I believe his name was Ron.There are other options closer to nightlife and more things to do. It was ok for one night, but on the 2nd night I wish we were closer to restaurants etc.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 5 2009 \\tA great place to stay and I rate difficultly!\\tOk, I went to priceline, entered where I wanted to stay and crossed my fingers. Found the hotel that accepted my rate, and again, crossed my fingers. Read some reviews on the hotel and was a little concerned, everyone complaining about using two elevators, and how terrible the people who worked there were. I was apprehensive from the start, ready for the worst, but when I arrived, the bellman gave simple directions (there were 6 of us, to include a 13 y/o 8 y/o and 3 y/o..) to get up to the hotel. Walk in the revolving door, by the escalator and take the elevator. WOW.. And people had compained about THAT? Ok, I figured it had to get much worse. Upstairs, at check in where the &quot;rude obnoxious&quot; desk people were according to another review, stood these two women who were MORE than happy to help us, and even went the extra mile to find us adjoining rooms, on the same floor as the pool deck.Ok, we went to the rooms, yes did take another elevator, but we made it with no effort (remember 3 kids!). Got to the room and expected the huge CSI crime scene another reviewer posted about, and the rooms were immaculate. I opened the curtain expecting a view commensurate with what I had paid, and POOF, there was the Chicago Skyline. Hancock Building one way, and Sears tower another, along with the river right below us. Yes, the restaraunt is over priced, but 3 blocks away is a fast food restaraunt. We used room service for desert only and had no problems with the delivery or service.The pool was a little chilly, but I believe it to be because the pool deck was kept at 80 degrees. The water was great once you were in it. Fitness room with a sauna was superb. If you want a complaint from me, it will only be that next time I use priceline, Sadly I am afraid that my experience won't be this great.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 5 2008 \\tThey gave my room away!\\tI was very impressed with the reservationist and had also received a nice email response when I inquired about the location. However, when I arrived at midnight after a grueling delayed flight, I was told they were overbooked. Apparently other guests decided to extend their stay, so they gave my room away. The hotel did rebook me and paid for the other hotel, but as a business traveler...that didn't help me personally since my client pays the bill. I was the one inconvenienced. I had to stay a mile away, and had to fight for a taxi to come back to my meeting in the mart early the next morning. This cost me much needed sleep. I would have appreciated an email or phone call telling me about the problem so I could have planned accordingly.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 27 2008\\tHoliday Inn works in a pinch\\tWe used Priority Club points for this three night stay. As a Priority Club member you can get $5.00 off the current parking rate (either self parking or valet). The rate was $23.00 with the discount which is excellent for self-parking in this area.The hotel itself is fine, although I would MUCH prefer two queen beds instead of two doubles, but we didn't have a problem sleeping. Pros -- during work hours you have inside access to the CTA brown and purple lines. Otherwise, you do have to go outside for a block or so to reach the CTA stop. Nice pool, but alas no hot tub!Cons -- we were there over Thanksgiving and it is a pretty chilly walk to the shopping areas. It would be great in summer weather, not a bad stroll at all. The rooms all have a pretty decent view. Our daughter who lives in Chicago, said we faced Oprah's apartment building, we were on the lookout but she didn't use her terrace... haha.Would I stay there again? Probably, if the price is right, but if I had other similar options I would try those. The hotel is nothing special, the CityScape bar on the 15th floor is a nice small bar with a great view. If you would like to sit somewhere in the city for a view I would highly recommend it. I think they have free appetizers on &quot;Hump&quot; day so Wednesdays would be a fine place to hang for a couple of hours!I did ask about rollaway beds because of the double bed situation, but the extra charge was $20 which I thought was unnecessarily high.It is an adequate hotel in a great city..........\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nov 9 2008 \\tAverage hotel with great location\\tPros - As other reviewers have mentioned the hotel is situated at the heart of downtown chicago .Few minutes from most of the popular attractions.There is a taxi stand just outside the hotel,which adds to the benefit.

       " 'Oct 28 2008 \\tLoved the Chicago Mart Plaza\\tJust returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel with 5 of my friends.We had very nice rooms, excellent service from everyone at the hotel. The concierge was very helpful with the planning of our vacation. The only complaint we had was that too much food was served with our meals. It seemed like a waste but I guess a lot of people would think lots of food was a really good thing. Food served in the restaurant was delicious and the wait staff very good also. The City Scape Bar is an excellent place just to relax at the end of the day and overlook the city lights.Overall experience was excellent and would highly recomend to any age group.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Oct 26 2008 \\tGreat hotel.\\tFirst impression is that the hotel is a bit strange - you have to go up to the 15th floor in order to get to the reception. The room was great and we had a great view of the river. We ordered room service one night and had a great meal. The bar on the main level had some great views of Chicago.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Oct 20 2008 \\tGood locationgreat views of the city and the river\\tIt is a super location next to the mart and convienent to good places to eat. It is a bit strange to enter on the main level and then must travel to the front desk on a upper floor. It is your basic city hotel but it offers beautiful scenery from the rooms.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 14 2008 \\tShould be a 5 star Hotel!\\tI cannot believe this is only a 3 star hotel! The building is absolutely beautiful and is connected to the Merchandise Mart - which has a food court and connects to the subway. The lobby of the hotel is comfortable and warm - and if you don't want to stray far there is also a restaurant. Also, the view from the hotel is amazing and you can see the Chicago river and overlook downtown. We stayed in a room with 2 double beds and the room was more spacious than any other Holiday Inn I have stayed at. The bathroom was also clean and was an appropriate size. The staff was very friendly and were quick to help us - they knew the city very well and provided us with maps and directions. They also called one of our tours to double check we knew the location of where it began. I liked the staff of the hotel and I felt that I was in a safe location.The downside is that the restaurant does not cater to vegetarians, or there is no safe in the hotel room.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 13 2008 \\tGreat location above average hotel mediocre service\\tI was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The view was excellent (if you get a view of the river). The hotel itself was above average, clean, and had a nice bar with a great view. Great downtown location. The staff could be rude, though- we had problems with the concierge (who didn't seem to want to be bothered), and room service (who told us &quot;they were too busy&quot; to bring some things up to our room, and we &quot;could come down and get it ourselves&quot;).\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 7 2008 \\tGood Service and Great Views in the Heart of Chicago\\tLocated at Chicago's Merchandise Mart in the heart of the Magnificent Mile, this Holiday Inn is perched atop the Chicago Sun Times building and the underground shopping mall known as the Merchandise Mart. Easily accessible from both Midway (about 8 stops on the CTA) and O'Hare (about an hour by CTA). Trains on the Loop stop at the Merchandise Mart, which is virtually at the hotel's doorstep. Better signs in the Mart would help guests find the hotel after exiting the CTA train.Rooms are small but comfortably appointed. Free Internet was great. Many rooms feature fabulous views of Chicago's lively canyon of art deco buildings and newer skyscrapers. The hotel's bar is an all-glass venue overlooking the river with the city's dazzling lights spread out before you. The spacious atrium hosts the hotel's &quot;Regions&quot; restaurant that features a nice variety of entrees, sandwiches, and salads.The hotel's location could hardly be better. An easy walk to Wacker Drive, State Street, Dearborn and Michigan Avenues. The River Walk is just yards from the hotel.A concierge desk sits in the lobby but is not always staffed. The front desk is very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful but somewhat understaffed. I had to wait in long lines to get information I needed.The only complaint I have about the room is that the walls are a little thin. I could hear an annoying cellphone conversation in the neighboring room.All things considered, this is a good Holiday Inn convenient to shopping, restaurants and a CVS drugstore.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 28 2008 \\tLoved It\\tWe booked this on priceline for our trip back for a Cubs and Bears game. We really liked this hotel and feel like we got a good deal on priceline. Loved that there was a Dunkin Donuts and other fast food choices right in the merch mart. Great for access to the Brown Line. It was clean, comfortable, nice staff, great lobby and bar with a great view! Liked that the parking lot was close and and accesable. We would be happy to stay here again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Sep 14 2008\\tConvenient for downtown\\tVery convenient hotel for touring Chicago. Comfortable and efficient accommodation, although restaurants in the hotel itself too pricey for us! Sits atop the Chicago Sun-Times building and a five minute walk via second level walkway through Merchandise Mart (massive office complex with lots of shops + eating outlets) to the CTA station for easy access to the 'El' (elevated railway). Alternatively downtown shops etc 15 minute walk. Far cleaner and safer feel to this city than we had expected. 1,2, 3 or 5-day 'Visitor Pass' for all public transport recommended.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 4 2008 \\tA good bargain with killer views\\tI was most impressed with this hotel. The location was downtown but not in the most touristy, hustle and bustle part, which suited me and my husband just fine. This hotel is connected to Merchandise Mart, a design and shopping center of high end home furniture and design products. The hotel is right on the Chicago River with the Chicago Sun Times and Illinois Institute of Technology Art campus. A CTA transit station was very close by, and the Magnificent Mile and other attractions were within walking distance.The views of the Chicago River were outstanding! My husband and I got a room on the very top floor facing the river, which was as much of an attraction as anything else. We saw party boats, kayakers, and other vessels sail by. The room was a little older but clean and well-kept. The bed was reasonably comfortable, and it was relatively quiet. The hotel informed us that renovations would be taking place starting January. This is good, but I imagine that prices will go up. We received a pretty good deal on the hotel website, especially considering it was Labor Day weekend in Chicago.The hotel bar was very nice with amazing views as well. Good drinks, good food, good service, and good view.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Aug 20 2008 \\tNice view of Chicago\\tA nice and very central hotel. We had rooms on the 21th floor which gave us a really nice view of the Chicago river. The staff is friendly and helpful. Good beds to sleep in. However, the maids forgot to change toilet paper. On the third day we ran out of toilet paper and it was not fixed.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 9 2008 \\tGood location\\tMy husband and I were doing a driving trip that started in NJ and landed us in Chicago for 3 days. We booked this hotel through hotwire for $164/night. Because it was hotwire, we couldn't count on getting a queen or king bed and in fact we had 2 doubles. The beds were nice and comfortable.The location is above the Chicago Sun Times offices so you have to take an elevator up to the 15th floor to check in. After that you take another elevator across the lobby to your floor. Our room overlooked the indoor pool and was a nice enough set up. One problem in the room was the air conditioner. It violently shut itself on and off so that it actually startled us a little each time! To be fair, we did not complain about it so the hotel didn't have a chance to correct it but it made sleeping a little tough.I like hotels with gyms and this one was pretty good for a hotel gym. It had nice cardio equipment and some weights. My husband used the pool and it had so much cholorine that it burned his eyes - and he is usually not sensitive to that.The hotel itself is in a great location and there are some really good restaurants within walking distance. If you like Thai, go to Star of Siam, which is recommended on the hotel site. It's about 8 blocks from the hotel, delicious, and well priced.We also ate at the Chop House (also within walking distance). A well known spot in Chicago, it's a bit pricey but it's a fancy restaurant with amazing food (get the sweet potato with cinnamon butter - it's beyond delicious).We loved the aquarium (we walked to it and then ran along the lake but it's a bit far if you are just looking to visit). It has beluga whales and some interesting exhibits.I would stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 3 2008\\tWould return to this great location\\tWe met some friends here for a long weekend. Top floor view of the river facing south, worth the extra $10 as we enjoyed cocktails in our room with the view.The brown line eL stop is less than a 5 minute walk through the merchandise mart. The mart has several place to eat, some sit down, some fast food (dunkin donut).Staff very helpful.\\t\\n',\n",

I booked the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza hotel via Priceline for $120/night + tax, which was a great deal for the location and timeframe. I was pleasantly surprised - the location was great. It was about mile from Union Station as well as the Magnificent Mile. We walked everywhere from our hotel, but it's close to the El as well. Thought the rooms were fairly average, but clean. We also had a great experience at check-in. We arrived around 1 and were quickly checked into our room even though check-in wasn't until 3. The hotel clerk was quite courteous. I had read some reviews where clerks had been somewhat rude to customers booking through priceline. I definitely did not have that experience.Also the hotel bar was great - located on the corner of the building overlooking the Chicago River. It had a wonderful view and the drinks were extremely reasonably priced.All in all - had a great visit and would definitely recommend this hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 10 2008 \\tGreat hotel great price good location\\tBooked both hotel and airline via hotel website. Got great price for two people. (Rooms are not guaranteed: ie smoking, double beds, etc.) We were lucky and received a non-smoking with double beds. The location of the hotel is very convenient, walkable to the Loop and Mag Mile. The El - Brown and Purple Line is a block away and can be reached by going through Merchandise Mall. Some of the rooms had great views for the city, unfortunately, we did not, which was ok because we could venture outside to the see the real thing very quickly. Don't pay heavy prices for the breakfast in the hotel. Venture out into the mall and try the food shops in the court or Au Bon Pain outside, which has outside seating that will allow you a nice view of the Chicago architecture and river.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Jun 28 2008 \\tUncomfortable Beds\\tThe beds at this hotel are some of the worst that I can remember. I unfortunately was attending a two-day conference and had already prepaid for the rooms - a sofa would have been more comfortable. The beds also had three small pillows that were the size of a &quot;throw pillow&quot; - it was very awkward. Overall the hotel rooms, hallways, and lobby were very dated and in need of a make over. There are some good points to this hotel. There is free WIFI, location is okay but will probably need a cab to get to most places, nice bar with sweeping views of the city and river - some rooms also have this view. Also, the staff was very friendly and concierge &quot;Robert&quot; was helpful with restaurant recommendations and can get you last minute tickets to shows or the Cubs.If you can afford it, stay next time at a hotel that is closer to Miracle Mile, the Pier, or Millennium Park. By staying at this hotel you'll end up spending money on cab rides and have a bed made of rock awaiting you when you get back from your night out on the town.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 6 2008 \\tGood location but an average hotel experience..\\tLocation: Ideal location in Chicago, easy to commute to most main attractions and shops.Staff: Everyone we spoke to was very helpful. The lady who checked us in was quite miserable, but nevertheless they all seemed ok.Hotel: The hotel itself was OK. The hotel is sat on the top of a tower block starting at the 15th floor. When you arrive at the foot of the tower it is not straight forward on how you actually get to the hotel, we managed to find out by asking a gentleman, who had a similar experience. The room itself was very spacious but at the same time very average. We had problems with reliable hot water in the bathroom, most of the time the water was warm but not hot. We had a fairly decent nights sleep, although in the early hours I am sure I could hear what sounded like a washing machine going, which was quite loud. Although being high up is a good thing as you get no traffic noise. Another thing worth mentioning is the tremendous view of the surrounding city, from your room this is a visually stunning experience.Main features in the hotel are the beautiful swimming pool on the 16th floor along with the impressive fitness center. Also the lobby area and dining is visually impressive, the bar in particular offering great views looked very good. As with most Holiday Inn's the price to eat in their diner is a joke, you are looking at 30 dollars minimum or so per person for a standard meal which you can get down the road for half the price.Overall: If you want an OK hotel in a good Chicago location then this may be a good move, however for the $180 a night rate I am sure if you looked around you could do better. Everything about the general hotel is good, however the room itself is the weakest point.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 19 2008 \\tAverage hotel...pleasant but nothing special\\tHotel was clean and comfortable. Could use a bit of modernization. Staff was acceptable but did not go out of their way. Concierge had a hard time recommending a place for dinner. Free wifi was nice, but parking was expensive ($28), though comparable for this part of Chicago. Location was fatastic. The hotel bar has one of the most spectacular views I have seen of Chicago.\\t\\n',\n",

Chicago is a wonderful, allbeit very windy, city with lots of fabulous buildings, museums etc. Would definitely visit again but as to staying at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza I'm not too sure.\\t\\n\",\n",

A quick recognition of my Platinum Status opened up quickly a Riverview room (which I haD paid for). Platinum Status also recognised with some nice extra's. The room 2101 was a spectacular corner room with views of the city and river. Clean, fresh and plenty of natural light during the day. Only minor niggle was the door on the TV cabinet would not stay open.Free high speed internet in the room was of a good speed. Location is excellent - short walk to the Brown line with most of the main attractions within walking distance.\\t\\n\",\n",

At first all they said were smoking rooms. After we explained we had a rough morning where we had something ripped off from us on the train, she seemed more sympathetic and gave us room 2316. The joke was on us. It was an incredibly small room, double bed, and the decor from 1950's and not updated since. It was so upsetting. Especially since we over bid on priceline for $175 for this hotel and still getting treated like this. After a few hours, my husband went to talk to a gentleman at the front desk and asked if there were any king bed non smoking openings. Thankfully there were. We got 1808 - still gret view of teh river and sooo much more room and nicer decor. It saved the trip.I was surprised by being treated like 3rd class citizens here since we booked on Priceline. I had recently stayed at a Marriott in San Diego and booked that via Priceline and had the most fantiastic service ever from a hotel.We did get room service breakfast, which was okay. They forgot salt and pepper and I wanted tobassco for my eggs. Went I went down to the restaurant to ask for some, I was not greated with the warmest &quot;what can we do for you&quot; I had to barter for more salt. I guess it's had to come by in Chicago.We've been to Chicago many times via Priceline, but this was the worst experience yet for service and room. I would not stay here again due to service. Maybe if you book directly with the hotel you would get better service than an online disount place.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 9 2008\\tBeautiful view\\tI got a great deal but I booked directly with property 7 months prior to stay. Our room was nice enough and had a GREAT view! It was wonderful. Bathroom had peeling and stained wallpaper. It's about time for an update. Suprising that the bar, which serves food, allowed kids at 2:00 p.m. but at 4:00 p.m. when we tried to enter, we got turned away for having a 5-year old with us. That was disappointing since it's certainly not a state law - our child goes with us to drinking establishments that serve food all the time. I didn't think self parking was that expensive or difficult. I'd go here again if the price beats elsewhere downtown.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mar 14 2008 \\tGood Location\\tI stayed on business at this location. Very convenient location as it was next to Merchandise Mart. I had a nice view of the river and the accommodations were nice. Rooms were big enough to make you feel like you have some space.The parking is a little steep and I did not get a chance to eat at the hotel, but otherwise a decent stay. I am a PC member and they treated me well.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Mar 10 2008 \\tThe price was right\\tWe booked our room through Priceline and got a weekend rate of $62 a night. When we checked in, the woman at the front desk informed us that the hotel was sold out and the only room available was a smoking room with a king sized bed. After a little pleading, a non-smoking room miraculously opened up, but it only had a double bed. We decided that a double bed was better than a smoking room. While room 2116 had an incredible view, it smelled like smoke and there was definitely water damage that had occurred at some point. There were water stains all over the walls and ceiling and the wallpaper was pealing off. Our room was in no way sound proof. I could hear every conversation going on in the room next door, as well as all hallway conversations-which we heard all night long. The room definitely could use some updating-the decor was dated and the bed was as quite hard. It was a sizable room, but had limited furniture (double bed, night stands and a desk with a chair). There was definitely room for a chair and ottoman and/or a king bed. There was free internet, although it was a bit on the slow side. As others have said, having to take two different elevators to get to the hotel rooms is a bit inconvenient, but not horrible to deal with.I thought the location of the hotel was just fine. We took the blue line in from Ohare and then transferred to the brown line. Just one stop up and you are at the Merchandise Mart. You can walk through the Mart and get to the hotel. You can access both the brown and purple eL lines from this stop. The hotel is not far from Michigan Ave (if you don't mind the walk). We were able to get around in the city without any difficulty. Gino's East is just a few blocks north on Wells, but fine dining will require a cab ride. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant (prices were high for what you get), but did admire the bar located on the 15th floor (lobby level). It has a lot of comfortable chairs and tables to sit at and enjoy a cocktail and the view.So, the hotel was not fantastic, but the price and location worked just great for us.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 2 2008 \\tStill a good bet if you get a good rate\\tI got another great price on Priceline. Last time I stayed here I gor a fabulous room with a fantastic view of the Chicago River and the Sears Tower. Since I've seen that view, I decided to get a quiet room away from the elevator this time. Not much of a view of the &quot;courtyard&quot; and the top of the pool. However, it was quiet, and nicely furnished. The tub could have used a re-coating though. It was peeling a bit. Still all in all, it is a nice, comfortable hotel in River North and it is easy to get arounf the city. I will stay there again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Feb 27 2008 \\tGreat hotel and great location\\tAs we have been traveling to Chicago several times now, we have tried several hotels too. This is one of the best so far. We came in by train from New York and it was only a short walk from Union Station. The hotel is on the top floors of a pretty tall building, so you have to take the elevator up a few floors to get to the lobby. The lobby looked good, and had theire own staffed information desk were you could ask all kinds of questions, get directions and tips.Check in was fast and the staff was polite. The room was spaciouse with to beds, a desk and a big tv. The bathroom was nice, big and clean. The hotel was situated within walkingdistance of all the major attractions and there was alot of restaurants near by. We especially loved Rock Bottom Sportsbar and Restaurant. Great spare ribs, great prices.This hotel is worth every penny, would stay there again in a hearbeat!\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Feb 21 2008 \\tGreat Hotel\\tI booked my hotel at a great deal through orbitz from san antonio..the room had an excellent view of the river and downtown area..what i liked the best was that the brown line (cta public transportation) connects right into the merchandise mart where the hotel is located, there are also fast food eateries right in the mart..I found the hotel staff to be very friendly and always helpful..the only downside i found was the rooms, while the view was great there was no microwave, no fridge, also the area doesnt have much to offer for late night eating..you of course have the option of room service (not really cheap) until 1:30 am ..nothing really within walking distance unless you want to take a $ 5 cab ride towards the magnificent mile. I would recommend this hotel highly and would stay here again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jan 29 2008 \\tIdeal Chicago hotel for the price\\tI've actually stayed at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza twice. Once for a wedding (the reception was held in the banquette room with the spectacular view) and the other was just recently when I brought my nephew downtown for his birthday. Not many of the Chicago hotels have a pool but this one does. They have some nice breakfast choices...but room service is a bit pricey. They offer parking at a reasonable rate, but the cars are not covered as they sit in an outside parking area. There are very steep steps down to the parking area.There is a drive-up area to the front entrance. The hotel lobby itself is situated on the 15th floor so you need to take an elevator up once you enter the building. I've always seemed to find the cheapest rates on the Holiday Inn website. They provided us a room with a wonderful view of the river and Sears Tower. Its easy to get a cab. If you walk 2 blocks you can catch the el. The hotel rooms were average size. We had 2 double beds, desk , 2 chairs, tv with lots of first run and just released DVD selections for an additional fee. Video game rental for an additional fee. Electronic checkout. Bathroom was large and brightly lit. We went at Christmas time so the lobby was all decorated. Overall its a great place to stay for the price, but if you want to walk out onto Michigan Ave its a bit too west .\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jan 7 2008 \\tGreat View...Nice Room\\tI would have to agree with the last traveler! The views at this hotel are outstanding! I stayed there the first weekend in January and I have to say that my experience was good. The staff was friendly and helpful at all time. I would stay here again and plan to do so next month. If I based my decision to stay at this hotel off previous reviews I would not have done so because of some negative comments but I did not see any of this during my stay! I suggest everyone seeing for them selves!!\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Dec 30 2007 \\tSomewhat out of the way but still a decent downtown choice\\tI stayed here for three nights over the Christmas holidays and was overall pleased with this hotel, although the location is not optimal for sightseeing in downtown Chicago.Positives I booked through Priceline, and I had heard ahead of time that this particular hotel was unfriendly to Priceline customers. That wasnt my experience at all. The check-in clerk was very friendly and competent, asked about my room preferences (bed size and smoking/non),and gave me an excellent room that met my preferences. At check-out I had the same very helpful clerk, who seemed genuinely interested in how my stay was. There were no problems whatsoever with the bill. I loved the room  huge (king-size bed, full-size couch, and lots of floor space to spare), and a nice view west over the Chicago River and Chicago landmarks to the west (United Center, Ogilvie station, etc). Since the rooms begin above the 15th floor, you get a nice overlook. I didnt ask for a room with a view so I was thrilled to have been given one. The room was kept very clean. The water pressure and temperature in the shower were both fine. The rate I got through Priceline was extremely reasonable ($65/night). The Merchandise Mart el stop (Brown Line), food court, and shops are convenient. The exit from the el stop is directly into MerchandiseMart; this exit was always open during my visit and always staffed with a CTA staff member. The hotel was very quiet. I heard no street noise or noise from other guests. I did hear noise from the Ogilvie train station just to the southwest of the hotel, but I dont find train noise irritating, and I enjoyed watching the trains pull in and out of the station.Negatives/other factors This hotel is not especially close to the Mag Mile or the Loop, although its certainly within walking distance for healthy adults. Its not really close enough to just pop in during the day and drop off bags, etc. If you want to be within a block or two of Michigan Avenue or other downtown attractions, you may wish to choose another hotel. There are several good River North restaurants close to the hotel, however. (I would recommend researching nearby restaurants in advance.) The hotel has a pedway that connects the hotels building with the Merchandise Mart, and when this pedway is open, you can walk directly from the hotel to the Merchandise Mart el stop without having to go outside, which was great during the early dark cold winter nights. (You also thus avoid the dark and deserted area under the Wells Street part of the el.) However, the pedway is not always open; the Sunday I stayed at the hotel, it wasnt open at all, and the weather was brutal that day. When the pedway isnt open, neither are the Wellsand Orleans street exits from the mart, and you need to take the stairs or elevator down one floor, exit the mart at its south entrance(about halfway between Wells and Orleans streets), and walk outside to the hotel from there (about 3/4 block total). This pedway was, however, open late on Saturday night and also late on Christmas Eve. The hotel entrance is not necessarily that obvious (its on the south side of the building). You can use Google Maps street view to get a look at it ahead of time, which is helpful. If you want any el other than the Brown Line, you have to transfer either downtown or further north at Fullerton. This hotel (in my room at least) is still using the blanket/bedspread system  I much prefer the duvet system. The bed was adequate but not as comfortable as those in, say, Hiltons or Westins. The two lamps by the bed were not as bright as I would have liked. You have to transfer elevators to get to your room. One elevator takes you from ground level to the lobby on the 15th floor, and a second set of elevators goes to floors 15 and above. My room was on 17 so I usually took the stairs (well lit and unlocked on all levels). I didnt eat in the hotel at all so cant comment on that.In summary, for the price I paid via Priceline, I was more than satisfied with this hotel. All in all, I prefer the convenience of the many hotels in the Loop and nearer the Mag Mile, but this hotel was still within a reasonable distance, and the convenience of the el stop and the pedway (when open) made it more amenable to getting around than I had expected.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Dec 15 2007 \\tReasonable Choice\\tNice downtown hotel. Clean, friendly, very good buffet breakfast (for extra $15). Stayed after thanksgiving for 4 nights, $230 per night including taxes. Great view for part of the rooms (see photo attached). 1 Mile from Mag. Mile.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Dec 4 2007 \\tWorst stay in Chicago\\tWhen checking in on a recent business trip to Chicago, the front desk personnel noticed that I have booked the room through a discount travel website. Then she automatically assigned me to the worst smoking room in the whole place, right next door to the entry to their exercise room, without even looking to see if there was a non-smoking room. I told her that I am not a smoker. She said, &quot;The room isn't that bad&quot;. Obviously she had not been in that room before. Then, she suggested that next time I book a room directly with them if I wanted a non-smoking room. The smell in the room was so bad that I had to go out in the middle of the first night and get a couple of deodorizer sprays. The room smelled like a filthy ashtray. Upon returning home, I had to spend nearly $100 on dry cleaning bill. It seems Holiday Inn have signed up discount travel website to just to fill their worst rooms that would not normally sell under any circumstances. What infuriates me the most is that during my stay, the place was practically empty. For a discount of mare $15 off their regular rate per night ($165 during my stay), this experience left me with disgust and anger over the management and business relationship between lodging industry and discount travel websites. Lastly but not the least, when checking out of this dump to go to the OHare airport, the doorman kept me waiting for a cab (special cab) nearly thirty minutes, while not calling for any other cab. When the special cab arrived, it was an off-duty cab of his buddy who splits proceeds of the fare with him. That just tops it all with my nightmare experience with this Holiday Inn.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nov 27 2007 \\tNot what we expected...\\tWe stayed at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza on Nov. 16-18. It was just a weekend get-a-way. The hotel is situated in the top  of the Chicago Sun Times Building so you may miss it. We had to wait for a bellman to come get our luggage. There was only 1 guy on duty it seemed, but he was doing a great job. We did see other bellmen in the hotel lobby just standing around so Im not sure why there was only 1 bellman assisting guests when we arrived. The hotel lobby is on the 15th floor as others have stated. We had valet parking but the attendants werent always available so I suggest self parking which is $10 cheaper. The hotel is pretty dated so but be deceived by the pix.We booked thru Priceline. We asked for a non-smoking king with a lake-view. They were most unaccommodating. We received a non-smoking double room which faced the inner court with a view of the swimming pool and other guests rooms. From my experience it seems that hotels are less accommodating for people who book reservations through online discounted sources. The rooms were nice, nothing special at all. Walls are a little thin but we didnt experience any extreme noise throughout our stay. The water pressure in the shower was very low. They have free wireless internet which worked great.The hotel is a decent walking distance from the main downtown area (MI Ave) but the weather wasnt extremely cold. I would recommend driving or taking a cab to get around when temps are less than 40 degrees. Theres also not too much activity in that area. We happened to experience the Christmas lighting of MI Ave. There was a parade also. It was really exciting!! Therere plenty of restaurants and shopping and other things to do in Chicago. If youre in Chicago, please stop by Garretts on MI Ave. Their popcorn is deee-licious but you will have to wait in line so be prepared (it is WORTH it)!If youre looking for a great dining experience, check out the Melting Pot. But plan to be there for 3+ hours; the service is not slow  its just a FULL dining experience. Everything is cooked directly on your table. It was the best lunch/dinner experience Ive had. The chocolate fondue for dessert was the best!!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Nov 20 2007 \\tAverage... Next door to Mechandise Mart\\tIts a good walk from the nearest CTA stop, which is down in The Loop.Not bad if you consider the price and you do not mind walking to places such as Michigan Avenue.I would stay here again, but I have no need to stay by the Merchandise Mart and I would prefer to be closer to Michigan Avenue. It's an average hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nov 13 2007 \\tBland and Sad\\tStayed here for one night in a sad looking room, with no view. The place was clean but could use a major over haul. Having a meal in the atrium is like eating in an airport. The pool is good however as is the fitness center. The staff were friendly. The location is withing walking distance of the main attractions, but it feels to be a little bit cut off from the energy of a city center hotel. There is a good grocery story in the lobby which serves great sandwitches\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 5 2007 \\tAdequate choice for Chicago\\tThe Holiday Inn Chicago (Merchandise Mart) is correctly described as adequate. Stayed here for two nights as part of a quick trip to Chicago. Picked the hotel for the price above all but in some ways I guess you get what you pay for.Location: The hotels location isn't horrible; its just not that convenient. Youre close to River North and the Loop but not too much nightlife or shopping. It gets frustrating after the first couple days of navigating several elevators, flights of stairs, escalators and hallways just to get to a cab or train station. The hotel is good choice if you want to save some cash and don't mind walking a couple extra blocks to reach some sites. Rooms/Hotel: Clean just very plain and somewhat dated. Beds were OK and there was also the pillow menu which is standard at most Holiday Inn's now. Bathrooms were basic the lighting was too strong. Free Wi-Fi in all guest rooms. Restaurant: Didn't eat at the hotel because we thought it was way too over-priced. (Tip - Inside the merchandise mart is a food court that serves breakfast very quickly and cheaply). Check out Blueprint in the Merchandise Mart for close cocktails.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 21 2007 \\tworst service ever\\tThis hotel has the worst service ever. My company booked 28 rooms at this hotel, When we tried to cancel three nights in two of the rooms they charged us a $400 cancelation fee, even though we gave them 2 months notice. I tried to explain to them that I will cancel all 28 rooms if they charge us this fee, yet they don't understand that they will lose all this money, plus the extras like our dinners in the restaurant, parking, etc. They still made us pay the cancellation charge. Apparently they don't quite understand customer service, and how it can cost a lot of money.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 3 2007 \\tGreat location average otherwise\\tHoliday Inn Mart Plaza is rated as a 3-star hotel and I feel it is rated appropriately. It is located in downtown Chicago overlooking the river. The location is very nice, it is within walking distance to most of the Chicago attractions. Parking at the hotel is $27 per day. Hotel is situated on top of the Merchandise Plaza building. Lobby is on the 15th floor, hotel rooms are from 15th through 23rd floors. You have to use 2 sets of elevators to get to your room. First, from 1st to 15th floor, then use hotel elevators that will get you to your floor. We were on the 18th floor and the view was very nice. When I initially booked the room on the HOTWIRE, it doesn't specify which room it is,,, king, queen, smoking, non-smoking, etc. But the hotel was very accomodating and gave us a king non-smoking room. Staff and concierge were very corteous and knowledgeable. Room and bathroom were clean and of average size. However, it felt like the rooms need to be freshened up, maybe new decor and carpeting would do. Mattress was hard. Hotel has a nice size pool and an excercise room. Haven't tried their restaurant but the prices were on the high end. One word of advise if you are driving. The direction says to turn on N.Orleans street but you actually need to turn on Franklin street which becomes N.Orleans. Not knowing this, I kept driving a bit around the hotel and wasn't able to find an entrance. I had to call the front desk from my cell phone to get directions. Overall, if you are looking for a nice hotel in downtown Chicago where you won't need to drive and look for parking spot, Holiday Inn is a good bet. We paid $100 per night booking on Hotwire.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 1 2007 \\tAdequate\\tBooked the hotel &quot;blind-folded&quot; via Priceline at $130 per night plus taxes for 3 weeknights while on business in Chicago. Started with a standard room with no view, later changed to one with gorgeous view of the river, for $10 extra per night. Very much worth it.Beds are nothing special and the covers are the old kind. Although Holiday Inn prides itself on its pillow menu, I found them all to be very hard. Rooms were in average working order; had problems with the drain plugs in both rooms and had to rip them out of the sink to make it drain. First room wasn't cleaned properly; found a luggage tag right next to the desk, but didn't have a single bar of soap. Quick response from housekeeping though after I called.Front-desk staff was always helpful, and room service was on time and as expected. Large portions (breakfast at least). Wifi works well and is complimentary. Finally a downtown hotel that doesn't charge for this everyday amenity. Pool was very nice; large and deep. Just too bad parents can't control their kids these days and believe that 100 db screaming is &quot;cute.&quot; I didn't try the exercise room, but it looked modern, spacious and well-equipped.Not the hotel's fault, but I had severe cell phone problems in both the rooms I was in: T-Mobile signal kept coming and going. Was mostly a problem on the southward facing side. Odd.Overall, I would return here if I was in a crunch or just on vacation. For business, I would prefer the Wyndham. :-)\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 29 2007 \\tGreat View\\tWe stayed Aug. 16-Aug. 19. We flew in to Chicago to celebrate my birthday at my mom's favorite restaurant and catch a game at Wrigley field. Location was perfect. We were only there two and a half days but saw everything. Sears Tower, John Hancock, Michigan Ave, The Navy Pier (ate at Bubba Gump's), watched the Cubs beat the Cards in the rain, took a water taxi down the river and a horse drawn carriage at night. The Hotel has spectacular views. We did not request specific rooms, as we did not plan to be in the hotel much but had a perfect view of Sears Tower. The atrium lobby was nice to sit and have a cocktail before going to bed. Darryl at the bar was awesome. We had dinner at the restaurant the last night and the food was good and reasonably priced. The hotel was clean and the service was great. Don't let the elevators intimidate you, they were no problem. It was a nice stay and without a doubt will always stay at this hotel. If you like fondue, the best fondue around is at Gehas Caf in Chicago. It was worth the trip alone.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 20 2007 \\tDifferent. But I liked it.\\tNot your traditional hotel. Hotel is on floors 15 to 22 of the Chicago-Sun Times building. Do a Google Images search on &quot;Chicago Sun Time Building&quot;. Find the picture that says &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; on the side and &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; on the rooftop. The hotel lobby is on floor 15. You can see the larger windows on the 15 floor. To get to the Chicago CTA, you have to walk thru the shopping mall part of the Merchandise Mart. The Merchandise Mart mall also has some fast food places, but some are closed on weekends. Furnishings showed some signs of age but they were clean and adequate. City views (if you get a city view room) are spectacular. Good pool, reliable internet connection, good exercise room. I'd stay there again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 15 2007 \\tNot the greatest but not bad either.\\tMy husband booked this hotel at the last minute because it had a pool and complimentary breakfast. We orginally were booked at the Hyatt Regancy.The worst thing about this hotel is that is it 15 floors up and to get from the parking gargage (down a long hallway) to the elevator and then to another elevator to get to your rooms takes about 15 minutes.The rooms were okay. Nothing great about them. The room was clean. The shower water pressure was awesome! The beds were hard. They do have a pillow menu where you can pick the &quot;type&quot; of pillow you would like. We had a nice view of the city. We walked everywhere. It was a long walk w/ 2 children and a stroller but we all survived. We walked to Michigan Ave, Navy Pier and Millenium Park. I think next time we will pick a hotel a little more centrally located. We had free breakfast because it was included in military discount. It was okay. Never would I have paid $15 a person for it!!!! Our bill before the coupons taken off was $59.32 for 2 adults and 2 children. Basic foods: eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, sausage, fruit and bagels.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jul 29 2007 \\tdisappointing\\tI have had very good experiences with Holiday Inns, however this one was a disappointment. My university called ahead of time to pay for the room and confirmed this, but when I got there they had no record of it and were not particularly interested in solving it. Much of the building smelled like roach spray, and when I asked the bell staff for directions one night I got an irritated list of a string of streets that did not help at all. The concierge the following evening was much more helpful.The rooms were clean and the restaurant passable, but I was not overly impressed.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jul 27 2007 \\tGreat location\\tWe got a great deal from Priceline and the hotel was more than we expected. It was a family trip to Chicago, because my niece Tori wanted to the American Girl Store. The location is perfect downtown, right next to Merchandise Mart, but not so busy. It is a cheap cab ride to Michigan Drive, (I suggest you take a cab) or a close drive to everything if you drove.The hotel is in the upper half of the Chicago Sun-Times Building and the hotel staff is the best. For example, the car battery on our Honda Odessey went out, so the parking valet got his jump box and gave us jump! I know he was supposed to do it but he did anyway!\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jul 27 2007 \\tThis hotel needs someone to give them the BUSINESS!\\tI was in town for some business meetings and this hotel offered a rate for the company I was visiting but was still $180 per night.The good: The rooms were clean but still have old fashioned bedspreads. HINT: Get mattress covers and duvets like Hampton!They have a &quot;pillow menu&quot; to get the pillows of your choice delivered. That is a nice touch.This hotel is easily accessed from the trains in Chicago. From MDW, take the orange line to a brown line and get off at Merchandise Mart. It is a short walk through the skyway/pedway to the hotel.The views are very nice. I had a corner (#1745) and had a panoramic view.Now for the bad:I travel frequently for business. The wireless was unavailable to several of our group members. They offered a &quot;box&quot; that picked up the wireless signal and connected like a LAN. Still nothing. Their help line suggested I turn off my virus software. Our company does not allow that and it does not impede my ability to use wireless networks at any other hotel. To check in for my flight, I used the business center. I had to pay $6.47 for the 6 minutes I used the internet. This is a bad feature for a hotel trying to attract business travelers. Nearly every hotel offers this for free now.My colleagues room was 1645 and the smoke smell on that floor and in her room was awful. If it was me, I would have asked to be moved.I think you can do alot better for business travel in Chicago with the other hotels in the vicinity. A few extra bucks is worth being able to connect and use a business center.I would NOT stay here again for that reason alone.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 26 2007\\tHated the Holiday Inn-Mart Plaza!\\tI came back from a trip to Chicago, IL. We stayed at the Holiday Inn-Mart Plaza. I will never ever stay there again! The room had an odor and the vents had not been dusted!! The cleaning personnel stored all the cups and glasses in the same area/room with the soiled and wet towels. When we passed by to go to the lobby to eat, we were taken aback! We didn't use their cups and glasses; we purchased cups at Walgreens. My sister requested a roller-away-bed ($20.00 per night), but she asked that they take it back, because it had a musty ordor. The breakfast buffet was $15.00 per person, that is way too much! I paid over $6000.00 dollars to stay (2 days), but never ever again! You have to pay to use the computer and the printer. The location is great and the lobby is beautiful, but when you go to your room, you're in shock. I wish I had a photo of the room. I believe if you're paying over $600.00 dollars, you should get something free. I could have stayed at another hotel paying the same price. Please learn from my error! Overall, the hotel should tear down and rebuild! I give this hotel one star. Please do not make reservations at this hotel!!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 6 2007 \\tWell...it's a Holiday Inn\\tOn this very busy weekend, during which graduation ceremonies were being held at the U of C, hotels in the downtown area were going for at least $250 a night, including the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. We booked through Priceline about a week prior and were ok with the $147 per night rate. With Chicago's steep tax rate, we ended up paying $166 per night. Not cheap, but at least it we didn't pay full price. We were originally booked at the Club Quarters but decided we might need more space since we travel with a toddler. Both hotels cost the same and, in the end, we traded location for square footage. The Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is located on the northern bank of the river, just before it splits. Although downtown Chicago is very walkable, it seemed most sights and restaurants were right near Michigan and Wacker. So, any sightseeing trip started with either a 15-20 minute walk or a $6 cab ride. If we were to visit Chicago again, we'd probably give the Club Quarters a try.The hotel is housed in the upper 8 floors of the Chicago Sun-Times building and is connected to the Merchandise Mart via a walkway. Although the website and the hotel's tv channel claim that all rooms have a view of the river, they do not. We had a view of the indoor pool. The special Priceline rate did not include breakfast.The hotel staff was always helpful and informative. We arrived at the hotel at 1 p.m. and a gentleman by the name of Angel was nice enough to check us in then instead of 3pm. He also recommended some sites. In the evening, when our toddler wanted milk but all stores were closed, the restaurant staff generously poured us a glass of milk to take to our room at no charge. When you travel with a two-year old, small details like these make all the difference. Just FYI: stores in Chicago close early.The room was clean, although, it needed some updating. Most notably, the hotel has not switched to duvets. They are still using bedspreads which are, well, usually very dirty as they are not changed after each guest. The Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is about a 10 minute walk from the Brown El Line (through the Merchandise Mart) which will take you into the Loop and all other El connections. Wrigley Field and the University of Chicago were each about a 25 minute ride on the El (Wrigley is north and the U of C is south). Nothing else is in very close proximity to the hotel. Everything is about a 20-30 minute walk. Bottom line: The price was good but the location was not great. I would stay a little further east (closer to Lake Michigan) next time.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jun 22 2007 \\tWonderful Service Decent Rooms\\tBooked the rooms from holiday Inn website, we called to see if we could check-in early and they let us check in at 1:30PM instead of 3PM. Also you can request a room with a view.We booked two rooms at $165 each for 2 nights. Parking is $27 per 24 hours with in and out privilege. I have paid more for hotels downtown without much amenities. The free-wifi was nice. Everything is just a little walk away, make sure you get a map from the concierge at the lobby. They were really helpful. The hotel lobby is pretty nice and the first night after we came back to the hotel, a friend and I just sat there and talked.  A CTA transit station is a block away you can get to it through the Merchandise mart. I would recommend this hotel.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 21 2007 \\tOkay... but wouldn't stay again\\tThis hotel was okay. It did not have a traditional hotel bar area. The rooms were average. Hard beds and missing nice bedding. I would not stay here again. Pay the extra money to upgrade to a nicer hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 4 2007 \\tView Made It Worth it\\tWe were on the 21st floor and had a magnificent view of the Chicago River. Staff were friendly and helpful in giving directions to attractions and train routes.Rooms were average. The beds were kind of springy, but somewhat comfortable after a couple of nights there. The bathroom fan didn't work and we were offered another room, but since we had settled and fallen for the view, we opted to go without a fan. Our room keys kept on getting deactivated-happened three times, but they said it was because of carrying them close to cell phones. Housekeeping was late once out of the four days we stayed. We didn't have our room ready when we came back mid-afternoon. The location is in a secluded area-perhaps it was because we stayed during Memorial weekend. When it's a regular work-day there's a hustle and bustle of people coming in and out of the college located in the same building and Merchandise Mart. Go across the walkway to access a foodcourt, CTA Lines, look through the furniture/furnishing showrooms, and post office during the weekdays. Michigan Avenue is about 15-20 minute walk from the hotel. It's a nice walk on a good day or $5 for a cab drive there. With all the walking we did, we got to know the streets real well. We felt pretty safe walking around the area late at night.Parking-On Sunday and Monday (a holiday) we parked for free along Wacker Drive. The other nites, I parked in a parking facility located about a block and a half on Lake &amp; Franklin for $22.25 for 24 hrs vs. the $27/night at the hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 30 2007 \\tVery convenient hotel\\tThis is the hotel that came up with my Priceline bid - far lower than any of the rates I noticed looking thru the reviews quickly &amp; we couldn't have been happier with it.Our stay was over the Memorial Day weekend - Sunday &amp; Monday night. There is an enclosed walkway to the Brown Line (CTA trains) which we discovered was closed except during business days. The walk outside takes just as long as the winding corridor you need to walk thru. The stop across the way makes it quite convenient to all of Chicago. We were not at the hotel much but it was quiet, clean, friendly staff, and very comfortable (especially after the rock hard beds we had stayed at outside the city). Also they held our luggage until we were leaving which made taking one of the last flights out a lot easier.The views were great - we were on the 22nd floor, outside room. The lobby is an open area that extends all the way up creating a square. I do not know if the inner rooms have any kind of view.One reviewer is correct about the restaurants. You are staying in a business district of Chicago so there is not a lot of good restaurants 5 steps from the door but with CTA so convenient that should not stop yoiu from staying here.No matter when you go look into the Go Card thru the CTA if you are not driving - buy it for the number of days needed &amp; pay one price for unlimited use. Also, during the summer months there are a lot of free trolleys to take you to &amp; from the major sites.I had ditched my rental car before checking in so I can not say anything about the parking.\\t\\n\",\n",

I was originally expecting less than what I got. Stangely, the lobby is on the 15th floor, but what a view!! It takes 2 elevator rides from the ground floor, one to the lobby and another to your room floor. I stayed in a well-appointed room, very clean and extremely comfortable. The view from my 23rd floor room was the best ever. (Thanks to the desk clerk that suggested this room, some of the rooms face other nearby buildings). Ask for a southern view. Smoking is limited to the 16th floor, apparently. I didn't have an opportunity to try the onsite restaurants. The area is safe and very central and I found it very close to shopping, great restaurants and transportation. (Kudos to the CTA, a great service). I'll definitely put this near the top of all hotels I've visited.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 24 2007 \\tgood position - beware students!!!\\tExcellent position for price - pleasant walk along the river right down to Navy Pier (about 30 mins) - passing State Street, Michigan Ave on way - Must visit Millenium Park on Michigan - lovely relaxing place in midst of all shops! - Hotel great to hop on and off EL train - due to high level of rooms great views of Chicago. Just one problem - BEWARE STUDENTS - there seems to be some connection with the local university (part placed in same building) and those staying in the hotel had no consideration for other guests. Despite me phoning the night-desk they were determined to wake everyone up on their floor. Partying until 3.00am is a bit much for those of use trying to sleep. Otherwise staff very helpful and good bar and restaurant - also many eating places around. Maybe management should consider educating the students or maybe they don't care!!!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 15 2007 \\tHoliday Inn an average hotel\\tI booked the stay through Priceline, getting $125/night NOT including parking. Parking is an additional $26/day. In the end, this hotel was average -- nothing astounding but nothing offensive. It certainly isn't in a class with the Sheraton on the Chicago River in terms of luxury. The extra parking charge was a surprise since another guest said parking was included in her rate. Probably because of the &quot;walk-in&quot; rate designated for Priceline bids. I was lucky to get a non-smoking room (since this was also not guaranteed for Priceline bids). The room was clean. However, two housekeeping staff entered my room with a key in the first 10 minutes I was in the room and this made me a little uncomfortable. Wireless internet was free, but it would reset after a period of time causing me to lose email content. I had a view of the top of the swimming pool -- so not a great Chicago skyline to compensate for the long trek to my meetings nearer to Michigan Avenue. Cabs were VERY plentiful, though trek from the parking to the hotel lobby was a real hike. The access to the elevators from the garage was not well marked and I had to basically lug my bags across rocks to get to my car. I wouldn't go this route in the evening as there are definitely dark alleys around. To boot, a cab driver swiped $5 from me, but this isn't the hotel's fault -- just a word to the traveler -- when you ask for change, count CLOSELY before you exit the cab.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 14 2007 \\tadequate -- awkward location\\tI was there for a conference and the hotel booked late (my bad) and through hotwire ended up about a mile from the hotels where the conference was held. It is actually a lovely walk along the river so that wouldn't be a problem -- except it was a bit of a drag in the rain and snow.Got off to a bad start when greeted with the notice that their Wifi was down -- this is critical to me traveling and I had lots of business I needed to conduct using the net -- so not having this essential tool for 24 hours was a real drawback. I had planned to take care of several important tasks that evening that I couldn't get done because of this.The room was fine. A basic clean holiday inn type room. The view was of the airshaft. At least I didn't end up with a room on the inner lobby which I would imagine would be noisy.Having read about theft in this review site (after I had received the hotwire pick) I looked into leaving my camera and laptop in a safe deposit box while I was out -- their boxes are tiny and won't handle anything but documents. Given their obvious concern about theft (lots written in the documents), it is unfortunate to have neither room safes or adequate security boxes.There is a pretty fair deli on the first floor of the building which was convenient -- especially since the neighborhood is not particularly good for small restaurants etc. Room service breakfast was prompt and good. They even provided the hot milk I requested (to make my own latte with the room coffee)fair value if the location is convenient for you.,\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 12 2007 \\tGreat View Great for Kids!\\tMy family stayed at this hotel over Easter Weekend. We enjoyed our stay in Chicago, visiting a few museums. The kids under 12 eat free in the hotel at every meal. The only drawback, is that the prices for adult food are high, and when they take the price of the child's food off, they leave on the full price of the tax before the discount, and added the tip themselves, with the full price. This aside, the food was still great, and the pool was a lot of fun for the kids. We had two rooms to accomodate all of us (we have 5 kids) and the views of the city were really beautiful. The staff was excellent, friendly and helpful. The beds were fluffy and comfortable, and we had a large television with all the cable channels to watch in the evenings after a day of sightseeing. I would definitely tell my friends to stay at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 27 2007\\tA good hotel with great views\\tStayed at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza over President's Day weekend, booking the rooms on Priceline at $75 per night.We were in Chicago for a weekend to enjoy the city, so our time in the hotel was limited. The location is convenient for driving in and the parking lot is more than adequate. If you're on a business trip to the Loop, this would certainly be a good choice. For a weekend/family getaway, you may want to look for something like the Hyatt Regency just to be closer to Michigan Ave and the main tourist sites.The layout of the hotel, entering through the building lobby and then proceeding to the hotel lobby on the 15th floor, is somewhat inconvenient, but certainly not a problem. Unload your bags before you park.Parking is $27 a day with unlimited use, so if you'll be traveling by car during your stay, it's a good value. Otherwise, the El Brown line stop at Merchandise Mart is located a block east (through the Mart building). Michigan Ave is a six block walk to the east, certainly doable, even in winter.Room had a great view looking over the Chicago River and the Mart. Room was very good size, bed was comfortable and the bathroom was fine - all in all, this is a very nice Holiday Inn. It's certainly a great value on Priceline, and would be a good value in general.\\t\\n\",\n",

Location is ideal; there is an enclosed walkway to access the above-ground mass transit, the &quot;L.&quot;Our room was comfortable, spacious, plenty of towels, TV worked fine. Beds were acceptably comfortable. The view was amazing - we were on the 21st floor. The hotel itself begins with its lobby on the 15th floor - so every room has some kind of view of the lights and the city.Our bathroom had a large crack in the sink. Our children were told by other kids in swimsuits that the indoor pool was cold.Room service prices were outrageous (and they like to heap on taxes and extra fees and gratuities to the point of being beyond belief!) and there is no nearby quick food on a Friday night, we discovered. We recommend breakfast or other fast meal at the Billy Goats Grill located in the adjacent &quot;Shops at the Mart.&quot;Our room rate was $135 (closer to $180 with taxes) for two double beds but it did include free self-parking. The entrance is very difficult to find; it is at the side of the building and poorly marked. From our parking space (outdoors), it was quite a hike up many, many icy stairs to the Sun-Times lobby, from where guests take a direct elevator to the lobby on Floor 15.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Nov 5 2006 \\tChicago River North hidden treasure hotel\\tI booked Holiday Inn Mart Plaza through Chicago's Convention &amp; Tourism bureau website at a bargain (for Chicago) weekend rate , $155, and was very pleased. Our king non smoking room on 20th floor had a great view of the Chicago River, skyline and Merchandise Mart (photo). Room was quite large and very pleasant with king bed, sofa bed, cocktail table, desk, and TV armoire. Attractive, modern, if somewhat generic Holiday Inn furnishings in room. Bath was clean and everything worked well. Extremely quiet with no noise from El, traffic or other rooms, which is not something you can say about all Chicago downtown hotels. Dramatic atrium lobby. Pleasant, helpful, courteous hotel staff. I even received a breakfast/parking discount coupon for using my Priority Club card. Minor annoyance, hotel is hard to see from street level and a bit tricky to reach by car. It's marked by a few small, hard-to-see signs and is located on one-way (northbound) Orleans street. It's next to the landmark Merchandise Mart, and very easy to find once you know where it is. HOLIDAY INN sign on roof is not visible from street as hotel is located on 15+ upper floors of Chicago Sun Times building. You also need to take an elevator to lobby at 15 then change to hotel elevator. On site and nearby garage parking is abundant, relatively inexpensive at $24 per day, and lots of restaurants in area.  Walk or short cab ride to Loop destinations, theater district, River North bars and restaurants, Magnificent Mile, Sears Tower, and State Street shopping. We did not use the restaurant or lobby bar but they looked fine. There is a pool and fitness center, but we did not use them.I am a demanding, frequent traveler and I highly recommend the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza, especially for weekend getaways at reduced rates. It would also be an obvious choice for downtown business travelers especially if your business is in Merchandise Mart.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 12 2006 \\tok hotel with low beds\\tStayed at this Holiday Inn over a Sunday and Monday evening. the hotel was busy, as it was the same weekend as the National Restaurant Ass. conference. The only reason I chose this hotel was because of the good rate for that weekend.Thanks to reviews here, I was ready for the whole &quot;walk in at the ground floor and take an elevator up to the lobby&quot; business, which wasn't a big deal. Didn't eat at the restaurant or use any hotel services so I can't comment on those. The only thing that stood out for me, is how low the beds were to the ground. This wasn't bothersome, however it was the only thing of note, in an otherwise average stay. I believe it was mentioned in an earlier review, but on weekends, the underground passage to the Brown Line station (which is in a building across the street) is closed. You need to cross the street, and in our case, we had to have a security guard give us access to the elevator to head upstairs to catch the train. A bit different, but again, I was prepared based on an earlier review.Also, be prepared to wait for a cab if you have an early morning flight. On a Tuesday morning at 5:30AM, I guess because the hotel is actually part of another building, there were no cabs out front. I had to push a button in order to have a light flash on the street to get the attention of cabs, which took about ten minutes.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 8 2006\\tNice view close to trains\\tI've stayed at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza twice and was impressed. The hotel is on top of the Chicago Sun Times building, so all the rooms are on &quot;high floors.&quot; Priority Club members get a $5 off coupon towards breakfast or parking. I used it for breakfast which was quite decent.If you take the train, your best bet is the Brown line. Get off at Merchandise Mart, walk through the building, take an escalator down to ground level and then the hotel elevator up to 15th floor. I don't remember many signs, so you might get lost. But at least you're insulated from the heat or cold (depending on time of year). The Brown line is convenient to the Loop as well as the Lakeview/N. Halsted area. Connect at Clark St station for the Blue line to/from O'Hare or Orange line to/from Midway. If you don't have much luggage you can't beat $2.For N. Michigan Ave, you can walk, take Bus 125 or a taxi ($7-10). There's a business center but they charge for internet. You can also use the TV internet for a fee. But, for simple e-mail and net surfing, head over to the Apple Store on N. Michigan Ave and do it for free! There's a Starbucks, Klay Oven Indian restaurant, and a pharmacy down the block on N. Orleans, as well as several places in the merchandise mart for a quick bite.\\t\\n\",\n",

The service was fine, and parking was convenient. I was given a room with a spectacular river/downtown view.The room itself was serviceable, though not spectacular. Plenty of clean linens were in the room, and it was clean. The room was not large, but the bathroom was.

When you walk in, you are in the Mart Plaza, you must go to the 15th floor to get to the hotel. Desk staff were your typical holiday inn no frills staff-- nice, but not interested in your stay. The room is large, but outdated, including the carpet, curtains and the bed, which was not the most comfortable. A/C is a unit under the window.Nice sized bathroom. Room service was quite good and very fast and they had a nice selection on the menu. Great view, this was the best thing about the room.Hotel is within walking distance of some nice restaturants. Try Harry Caray's, great steak, large portions. It was a basic, no frills budget hotel, without the budget cost. $149 a night through a special group rate.\\t\\n\",\n",

I was only out of my room for an hour, that means there must have been employees waiting like vultures to work that fast.I was helping my company setup for NeoCon, and location was why we chose this hotel.

Minor problem with reservation (between what was reserved for me and what I reserved with Priceline), but it was easily straightened out; Excercise facilities were small and standard considering their service book in the room indicates it was recently upgraded-must have been in very bad condition previously; a jacuzzi would have been nice to go along with the pool.When we arrived, we were slightly confused as to where we would check-in (entrance on 1st floor of the merchandise mart and check-in is on the 15th floor), but once we were familiar with the area, it wasn't inconvenient.

       " \"Jan 19 2006\\tLeast ideal for Michigan Ave shopping\\tHappened to win this hotel through a bidding service and didn't pay much for the one night stay. I would NEVER have chosen this hotel on my own initiative, but it was an interesting stay that I wouldn't care to repeat.They say location is everything...well, if shopping on Michigan Avenue is YOUR preferred location, this hotel is just inconvenient enough from that area (train, bus, or walk) to make your trip less than memorable as one of your favorite visits. Even after you arrive at the hotel, if via public transportation, your adventure is just half fulfilled, as it's quite a &quot;maze&quot;, and about a 10 minute walk, from the bus/train stop to, eventually, arriving at your room. Once again, this is NOT the hotel for you if shopping in Chicago's Michigan Avenue corridor.On the positive side, I must acknowledge that the physical appearance of this Holiday Inn is above average of the typical ones you would find. With that said, everything beyond the physical attributes is VERY MUCH typical Holiday Inn -- including a very average staff.Suppose I have grown accustomed to the professionalism of excellent chains that are highly regarded for outstanding customer service. Upon my arrival at the front desk of the Holiday Inn-Mart Plaza, I was quickly reminded that I was about to take SEVERAL steps down in customer service professionalism from what I have grown so accustomed to in my travels. The chain to which all others are to be compared is Marriott (of course in my humble opinion) -- impeccable customer service in EVERY property that I have been a guest. Marriott definitely has a genuinely desire to please their guests, while my overall experience at the few Holiday Inns I have stayed has been pretty much the opposite.This location was no exception to Holiday Inn's overall lack of guest satisfaction. There tends to be no warm greeting at the desk, lack of genuine desire for satisfying simple guest requests/accommodations (rooms in certain areas, views when available, etc.). In fact, my perception is that their goal at the front desk was to get you out of their faces as quickly as possible -- not guest satisfaction.Needless to say, I will NOT be returning to the Holiday Inn - Mart Plaza and, since I have visited Chicago on NUMEROUS occasions in the past, I would STRONGLY advise travelers to seek alternate accommodations of some OUTSTANDING hotels in the Michigan Ave/Wacker Drive area.There are way-too-many great options in this wonderful city to settle for a hotel as mediocre as the Holiday Inn-Mart Plaza -- you can EASILY BEAT the location and, especially, the professionalism (or lack thereof) of this hotel among the vast array of hotels in the city of Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",

To get to the &quot;L&quot; you don't even have to go outside, just walk through the Merchandise Mart. From our room, we also had an excellent view of downtown and the Chicago river. We didn't experience some of the problems that others had, we thought the beds were comfortable and the walkway to the Merchandise Mart WAS open on a Sunday. Our only complaint was that the indoor pool was very cold...too cold to swim in. Also, their beakfast was quite pricy (even for a hotel). However, I do recommend staying here when in Chicago.

One of the places we wanted to visit was the One of a Kind Show at the Merchandise Mart so this was a good location for that. We were dissappointed in the show since they had high priced art which is not what we were looking for. We really liked the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful and we had no problems getting extra soap and towlels or whatever else we needed. Our room was on the corner facing the east and we had a beautiful view of the city especially at night with the lights. We had a rate from the Holiday Inn website that included breakfast for 2 for $10. We had the breakfast buffet which would have been $15 each if we would have had to pay for it so this was a good deal.

This hotel was further away from the Magnificent Mile area where I've typically stayed before. It was still very convenient since the El brown line stops right at Merchandise Mart and you can walk through the Mart and across a walkway without ever going outside - great for the Chicago winter. **However, I unfortunately found out the hard way that the walkway is closed and locked all day Sundays which makes getting to the el more inconvenient to say the least.**Also, fyi - many of the places we typically go in Chicago are more convenient to the red line which took some juggling to get to from the brown line.The hotel lobby was very nice and the staff was extremely helpful to us. I also liked having wireless internet available for free in our room. The room was clean and nice, nothing special. The beds were strangely low to the ground and not comfortable at all. That feeling was shared by each of the others in my party as well - something that was pretty important with all the walking you typically do in Chicago. I would not go out of my way to stay here again, but I would not dissuade anyone from staying here. It's clean and safe and the location is close to the loop and downtown.

We thought we would end up with a poor quality hotel based on information we found on other websites, but we were pleasantly surprised. We were glad to get a nice room with an incredible view! The downsides: The parking lot is very inconvenient, especially if there on a typical Chicago day...blustery and raining. We decided it was worth the extra money to valet park once we saw the parking lot and the fact that we had to carry suitcases up a huge flight of stairs! Then when you get inside, you have the large lobby that is part of the merchandise mart before you get to an elevator that takes you to the lobby of the Holiday Inn and then you take another elevator to get to the floor where your rooms are. I found all of this very inconvenient (especially traveling with a toddler!). The room was okay, not fancy, but clean. It seemed very busy, so there wasn't any personal attention if you are looking for that.\\t\\n\",\n",

Our room had a beautiful view of the Chicago River and &quot;The Loop&quot;. The hotel is very clean, and situated atop the Apparel Mart, across the street (but connected by passageway) to the Merchandise Mart. We travel to Chicago about once a year, and usually stay closer to Michigan Avenue. However, we really enjoyed this hotel's location, and its accessibility via the loop trains. Be sure to get a transit pass that allows you to unlimited use of the CTA trains and buses; there is a station adjacent to the Merchandise Mart that you can access without going outside. It's also convenient if you want to take the CTA train directly from Midway or O'Hare. There are also some excellent restaurants nearby on Wells Street. The hotel has some quirks because of its location. The lobby is on the 15th floor, above the Apparel Mart, but you can pull up to the front of the building where bellmen can unload your luggage and take it upstairs. Also, there is outside parking adjacent to the hotel. So while it may be easy to get lost in this unusual setting, we didn't have a problem getting to the hotel or getting our baggage unloaded.Finally, as you will note from some previous reviews, people can have very different experiences in the same hotel. But you shouldn't be put off by the negative reviews. This hotel is nice!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 18 2005\\tAsK Questions Before You Decide\\tThe great view of the Chicago River that I had out of my room somewhat offset some of the things that brought disappointment. I reqested a non-smoking room, but the room smelled like a smoking room. Had to call Housekeeping for a spray, but it's difficult to get that smell out of the carpet, etc. They advertise High Speed Internet. For me it turned out to be &quot;Very Low Signal&quot;, but it was free. The hallways, at least the one on the 21st floor felt warm as if no air was circulating and the temps outside were in the 80s. My room had a noisy old AC unit. The type that runs all the time and blows the curtains. Had to put a rubber band around the drape to keep it from flowing in the breeze all the time. If the noise of this kind of unit keeps you awake, consider another hotel.Pets are allowed in this hotel and they state this in their list of amenities on their web site. I saw one person with two dogs, but that was it during my two day stay. If you want to stay within a short walking distance of Michigan Avenue, consider another hotel closer to the Navy Pier. I walked to Michigan Ave., and it is a trip of several blocks, however, the route that I took was along the river and that helped make it seem shorter. They advertise &quot;soundproofed&quot; rooms, remodled in 2002. I didn't experience any noise from other guests, even though I had a room that could be made into a suite (adjoining room) which is typically more likely to be noisy due to the adjoining door inside the room. I suppose that the noisy AC could also have masked any sound from within the hotel. Sorriso Restaurant on the Chicago River is about three or four blocks from the hotel and if you like sitting very near the river, watching boats and river traffic, I recommend it. I received negotiated, relatively lower than normal room rates due to being with a convention group, but I wouldn't pay a higher rate to stay at this property. The staff's courtesy was about normal for a busy hotel. I had to have dinner at their restaurant one night and even though it wasn't crowded, the wait for service and check was too long.\\t\\n\",\n",

We made reservations for a king size bed in a smoking room, but they had not held our reservation and we ended up in a full size bed in smoking. Parking is terrible, we spent an hour trying to find a spot. The room service stops at 10:30, which is terrible for travelers who arrive late. Just finding the place was a trip and a half. when we couldnt find it by the directions from mapquest and their web site, we called and got directions from them personally, which put us in some loading dock zone. Over all, it was a terrible stay. the price wasnt bad for chicago though.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Apr 25 2005\\tExcellent value for money\\tOverall, a very good hotel, particularly for the money. The room was a decent size, the staff was extremely courteous, and the hotel seemed to be very well run. A couple of nice extras: free wireless internet access, access to the gym, and room service that delivered in about 10 minutes.The main downside for us was the hotel's location: an area where there isn't a ton of retail shopping (unlike some of the higher end hotels off Michigan Ave.). Also, the A/C was a little slow in cooling down the room, but luckily it wasn't a problem for us since the weather was chilly.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mar 17 2005\\tGreat stay! 3/05\\tThis hotel is pretty well located- you can get to an EL stop without going outside. The view was great, the river and downtown lights were right there! Got a good rate on Hotwire. A little hard to find by car, and parking is a bit steep, but public transit options are good. There was free WiFi in the rooms. The room itself was nothing particularly fancy, but everything was very clean and in excellent condition. I would highly recommend this hotel.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jan 8 2005\\tPet Friendly \\tJust returned from a New Year's weekend stay at the HI Mart. Trouble finding the place doesn't end when you drive in...You have to travel through a labyrinth to get to the actual hotel and your room because the hotel sits atop the fifteenth floor of the Merchandise Mart. However, that means every room has an outstanding city view. This hotel is PET FRIENDLY, which is always a big plus, especially when staying in major cities. That said, walking your pet is a bit of a chore: Must take hotel elevators to hotel lobby, then walk through lobby to take elevators to Mart lobby, then walk through Mart lobby and walk down numerous stairs to get to riverfront walking area. That area is great for pets, but I suspect some pooches have trouble holding it for the lengthy journey to &quot;go potty.&quot; Room was OK--Nothing special. Room service was efficient and a good value and among the best food I've had anywhere in my room. Novel idea: The housekeeping/room service staff actually quickly disposes of trays &amp; food left outside rooms in the hall; this is something that many hotels seem to miss. We got a good deal on the room booking a pre-pay advance purchase direct with HI, but after we got there, discovered that guests who walked in off the street were being charged less (more than $20 less). When I mentioned that to front desk staff, they simply shrugged and said, &quot;Oh, well.&quot; What would it have cost them really to give us a break or throw in breakfast to make us happy? That was disappointing.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " 'Nov 22 2009 \\tLuxury ~ Fabulous View ~ Top Notch Service\\tThe Chicago Four Seasons is above the 900 Shops along Michigan Avenue and is a great place to stay! We splurged and booked a Deluxe Suite on the 38th floor. The highlight of the rooms was the window seat nook that ran along the length of the lakeside view of the room. Nice cushiions and pillows made this a great place to curl up with the paper/book &amp; coffee/wine. Although my kids enjoyed lining up their Star Wars figures for the ultimate galactic showdown. Spacious two room suite with a comfortable FEATHER BED on the pull-out sofa (loved by the kids), plenty of floor space, chair, table, desk and HD tv entertainment center.Loved the bed in our bedroom--nice bathroom &amp; shower with a deep tub perfect for a bubble bath soak.I do miss having the convenience of a coffee maker in the room, but the complementary spa/pool area serves bottled water &amp; orange juice throughout the day and coffee in the morning hours.The pool is beautiful, large and welcoming with a great hot tub as well. Pool toys are kept in a large storage bin to be shared. We love the Four Seasons because of the special treatment our kids receive when we are there. Upon check-in, we found a tray of iced cow shaped cookies, milk in an ice bucket, a pitcher of chocolate syrup and a battery powered &quot;moo moo mixer&quot; the kids could use to mix up their chocolate milk. That was in addition to the crayons, coloring book &amp; Sorry board game placed on the desk.The next afternoon we found individually boxed cupcakes for each of them, and the following day glasses filled with gummi bears and a paper drink umbrella. They also love the child size fluffy white robes that are included for their use as well as the kid pack of bath amenities.Bob--part of the bell staff provided excellent service and greeted our children by name each time we saw him over our stay.These things matter and are part of the reason we love the Four Seasons.\\t\\n',\n",

Very clean, well appointed, friendly, helpful but not Fantastic. Now if it was half the normal rate it might be Fantastic. I base alot of my review on price compared to quality. I have stayed at some Fantastic places for little money (I like Chicagos Hotel Burnham better) and I have paid a fortune for incredible places like the Pebble Beach properties (well worth every dime). The location can't be beat. The beds are incredible. Will I stay again; maybe but not likely.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 14 2009 \\tBest hotel that I've ever stayed in\\tI travel quite often on business and have stayed in many nice hotels, this was the nicest that I have had the pleasure of staying in. The staff was excellent from the front desk to the bartenders in the lounge to the concierge and bellmen. Great location for shopping and dining. The room was very spacious and had a great view of the Chicago skyline. I wanted to take the bed home with me it was so comfortable. My wife didn't want to leave the hotel. Great job, Four Seasons, we will be back!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 23 2009 \\tA wonderful stay.\\tOn arriving at the Four Seasons we were met by pleasant and smiling staff - always a good start. We were upgraded to a superior room, a nice surpise, and Laura at the check-in desk could not have been more helpful!A special thanks to Blanca at the concierge desk, whose help went above and beyond my expectations.The room had a vast view of the city and made it easy to plan for whatever weather was coming our way! What can one say about the bed...was easily the most comfortable bed I've been in and the room and amenities were second to none. Attention to detail ranks high in my book, from the earplugs supplied at turn down to the toiletries/accesories provided in the fitness centre. While there were some renovation works going on, they made no impact to our stay - always plenty of hot water, room was quiet, and didn't see any workmen.The location was ideal for shopping and sightseeing and will very much be planning another stay there in the future.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 16 2009 \\tSimply the Best. A+\\tTo start, I am a frequent traveler and not particularly loyal to any one brand of hotel. I use this site religiously and always try to book the highest rated property that is within my price range. Luckily, for my recent trip to Chicago, I was traveling with a budget that allowed for some costs to be reimbursable within a certain price range, including hotel. This fact allowed me the luxury of staying at the Four Seasons and it was a luxury indeed. As I entered the main lobby (and each subsequent time I traveled through it) I was impressed with the sleek and modern floral displays that I have come to equate with Four Seasons properties. Upon check-in, I was upgraded to a suite on the 36th floor (room 3608), which had breathtaking wrap around views of the city skyline. This was a real treat! When I travel on my own and am lucky enough to be staying at a Four Seasons property, I like to order a cheeseburger off of their room service menu, since they are amazingly delicious, and this time was no exception. The room was spotless and the bed was honestly one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom was spacious and well stocked, as was the room's closet (there was even a humidifier in there!). My stay lasted a total of 3 nights and each day my room was made up and turned down whilst I away, no hassle. Also, when I requested assistance from the Concierge on accessing my online boarding pass for my flight home, she was happy to print it out for me and happily gave me directions to where I wanted to go, along with a nice small street map. Overall, I had a fantastic stay at this hotel and would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. I've read some of the other reviews and noticed one about the water being turned off - on Sunday night when I returned to my room around 10pm there was a note under the door informing me that my water would be off the following day from 9am - 4pm, but since my flight home the following morning (Mon) was departing very early, this didn't really impact me. Perhaps my positive feelings about this hotel would be diminished if I were indeed effected, but who is to say. What I do know is that I had a fantastic stay in a lovely property located in a great part of Chicago. The hotel is attached to a mall, which was very convenient when I had to run out and buy a dress last minute - you can always count on Bloomingdales! Also, I would be remiss if I failed to give a proper shout out to the great people at Bobby's Bike Hike Bike Tours! I learned about them here on TA and am very glad that I decided to book a bike tour with them. Randy was an amazing tour guide and their neighborhoods tour showed me sights in Chicago that I have never seen before in a way that allowed me to truly experience the city's beauty. Bottom line - when I think &quot;Four Season&quot; I think luxury and this property lived up to my expectations in every sense of the word.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 14 2009 \\tLoved Four Seasons Chicago\\tMy son and I were visiting colleges in the area. We arrived at about 10:30am, way early. They took care of our bags and gave us directions to the Cubs' game. During the game called to say the room was ready. When were returned, the bags were in the our comfy room overlooking Lake Michigan. Check out the view of the sunrise from our window. Throughout, the staff and concierge were very helpful with our many questions and requests. Sent up coke and popcorn for my son, too. We felt very comfortable and taken care of in unfamiliar surroundings, which was just what we needed. Gym and pool were terrific, too. Great location between Michigan Ave and the restaurants on Rush Street.\\t\\n\",\n",

Water was shut off from 10 AM to 5 PM on Monday! Is this a 5 star hotel or class B real estate in NYC? Rooms were also dirty and staff was by far sub par. Overall, skip and go with many other great hotels the city has to offer. The 4S staff and management needs to be taught a lesson ...\\t\\n',\n",

On arrival, we got a free upgrade to a one bedroom suite with gorgeous views of the river. Complimentary birhday cake was also sent up to our suite -which was a suprise to both of us. Consistent with the 4 seasons culture/brand, the service we recieved from all the staff was both efficeint and friendly.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 22 2009\\tA Big Hotel In the Big City\\tEntering the Four Seasons' Lobby and taking the elevator up to the check in floor I was enamored and ready for something very special.The look was an opulent, old school marble with modern floral arrangements. Our check in was smooth as we were greeted with refreshments consisting of strawberry lemonade and Earl Grey cookies (later I discovered that theses weren't daily arrangements) We then made our way up to the room some 30 something floors up where we welcomed with a fantastic view of the Park, Lake Michigan and the neighboring John Hancock building. Beside the view however the room lost any such flash; it was very standard without much in the realm of design. Maybe this is what the Four Season's is known for.We settled in and ordered room service which was prompt and very expensive, I'm ashamed to even write the total. The food was very good and I recommend the burger highly. A day or two later we ordered breakfast and were very happy with the results; it's always aces when your eggs arrive hot. I had an asparagus egg white omelet that was delicious.While on the topic of food, the Hotel's restaurant was a pleasant experience as its decor was a time warp back to the late 1800s; dark wood, chandeliers and the like. The food was good and the service was attentive.I found the concierge staff to be very well informed and quick to react to all requests!The spa was well equipped with a wonderful pool, sauna and a steam room that the employees forgot to turn on in the morning which was my only real disappointment during the stay.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 14 2009 \\tGreat location beautiful rooms disappointingly spotty service\\tI love the Four Seasons hotel but the stay here was really disappointing - all because of something that this brand normally does so well - service.On the good points - great location, right off Michigan Ave, near Water Tower place so close to shopping, the lake. Nice rooms - we had a &quot;premier room&quot; that was really more of a suite.On the bad - we had problems with room service multiple times - once the order wasn't complete, twice they ignored the number of people we had and didn't bring enough place settings and were really inconsistent with what was offered - one day, large bowl of berries, the next, small; one day lots of bagels, next day, one.More concerning was the housekeeping. We had one bottle of shampoo when we arrived and one soap. for the sink, the shower and the tub. No washcloths were left and not enough towels. An old cup of coffee was never removed (through both turndown and regular service) and a bottle of champagne sat in a lukewarm bucket of water that was never replenished with ice and that soaked through to the table.May sound picky but really it's bizarre for this brand. It's almost as if they are into severe cost cutting.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jul 13 2009 \\tNice but I think if I had it to do over again...\\tThe hotel is very nice and the view is amazing. We had a room on the 44th floor that had a view of the lake, again just amazing. It was very clean and well appointed, however, there were a couple of things that were not quite right. First, the wifi access was sub par, it was free which was nice but I would expect a high quality signal and our room I was only able to get 2 bars. The second thing that bothered me was the desk was crammed into the bedroom, we had a beautiful sitting room off the bedroom move the desk, that I way I could get some work done in the AM while my wife sleep. The third was that the lobby was on the 7th floor, that meant one elevator to the lobby then a second elevator to our room. Now I would not have given up the view from our room for a first floor lobby, but in general I really like a large active lobby.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jun 8 2009 \\tGreat experience\\tMy husband and I traveled to Chicago with our 2 yr. old daughter for 5 nights. The hotel's staff was very friendly and completely accomodating in every respect. The concierge gave us appropriate kid friendly suggestions for restaurants and destinations. Housekeeping services were perfect. The restaurant was incredible for brunch and although expensive, it was worth it. The pool was nice, but really cold. The hotel is also located in a great location and near a lot of shopping and restaurants.On the downside, while the hotel itself is beautiful, it could use a bit of updating. We were in a suite so the space was ample and suited our purposes perfectly, however, I do think the room's furnishings also needed a bit of updating. Not the biggest deal, but we found it so annoying that you had to take 2 sets of elevators to get to the rooms.\\t\\n\",\n",

The living room window looked directly down Michigan ave. They had a bottle of champagne and chocolates in our room upon arrival which was fantastic. Dinner in Seasons was pretty good.

       " \"Mar 12 2009 \\tHard to Fault Four Seasons\\tIt really is hard to fault Four Seasons, in Chicago or anywhere else for that matter.We booked one night here on the way back from a ski trip. We had two adjoining rooms, one for myself &amp; my wife, and one for our two sons (aged 9 &amp; 11).On a previous trip to Four Seasons (in Las Vegas), on arrival the boys had been presented with gifts of cute little soft toys and so they were curious &amp; looking forward to seeing what Chicago hospitality was like! Sure enough, the hospitality starts in the lobby, where there were cookies and hot chocolate for everyone while we checked in. And we we got up to the rooms, there was a game (Kids Pictionary) and more cookies &amp; chocolate milkshake waiting for the boys in their room.The rooms were very nice: great view over the Lake (we were on 41st floor, I think), extremely comfortable bed, big bathroom etc.Breakfast excellent (didn't eat in the hotel for dinner so can't comment).We also made extensive use of the spa facilities - decent pool, although maybe a few degrees colder than I would have liked, plus hot tub, steam room, sauna &amp; massage facilities. For kids there were lots of floats, noodles etc to use in the pool which was nice.Helpful concierge recommended an excellent steak restaurant (Rosebud) nearby for dinner. We had a really great evening and that added to the overall enjoyment of our stay.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 24 2009 \\tOutstanding\\tFrom the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated by the staff like royalty. Travelling with three small children, we were upgraded before we arrived to a massive and opulent two roomed suite. Waiting inside the room were gifts for the children and chocolate cake and chocolate milkshakes.The room, although not yet renovated, was nonetheless excellent. Spotless, luxuriously comfortable and enormous. Free wifi. The hotel staff were all simply superb - especially the concierge staff - they remembered (after a single conversation) all the children's names and ours too. Our baby needed pureed food - no problem for the kitchen who produced excellent kiddie friendly food in moments.The food at the hotel is good also. Breakfast, and particularly the Sunday brunch, were standouts.The hotel has a terrific pool and spa.Although not cheap, for quality of service, attentiveness of staff and eye for detail this hotel cannot be bettered. Staff from other hotels should come here and learn how it is done.\\t\\n\",\n",

The greeting at the front desk was by a dour young lady who had the warmth and friendliness of a government bureaucrat. I was worried but after the sour taste she inflicted the remainder of my experience was excellent. The rooms are modern and well furnished. HD TV and padded window balconies make this a great place to relax. Pool is very upscale and well maintained. Spa was nice and I had an excellent massage by Paul. Room service was on time, hot, good and of course expensive. hotel bar was very upscale and fun. This hotel is a little quieter than the Ritz. lobby has less traffic and the street is not as busy (900 Michigan Ave mall is quieter than water tower place.) Staff are not as friendly as the Ritz, but certainly they are professional and efficient. I'd stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",

First, the view: We were on the 42nd floor with a view of the lake on one side and the city on the other. The sights were breathtaking and ever-changing. It was a real challenge to pull myself out of the room. Second, the bed: Wow! It must have been the combination of the featherbed and sumptuous linens because I have not been so comfortable or slept so well in a really long time. Leave yourself a few extra minutes before heading out for work or sightseeing to enjoy just laying there and taking in the views. Third, the service: As you can imagine, it was incredible. Everyone was extremely polite and helpful - always going out of their way to make our stay as easy as possible. Other pluses: fantastic spa and pool (you can use the spa sauna, hot tubs, showers, etc. even if you're not getting a treatment that day) and connection to shopping from the 6th floor (Bloomie's at your finger tips for everything you forgot to pack). One downside - I was not crazy about the food and while the oak bar was beautiful, the drinks were pretty pricey compared to the quality. Really, though - who cares? You should be out and about sampling all the great food Chicago has to offer anyway!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 11 2008 \\tOther Hotels Should Take A Leaf Out Of The Four Seasons\\tSimply amazing. Location's great, service staff fantastic (concierge remembered my name 4 days after speaking with me for less than 2 minutes) and attention to detail cannot be faulted.Not once was I interrupted by chambermaids either to make up the room or for turn down service although I was in the room at irregular times of the day.The Sunday brunch is also fantastic. A little pricey but well worth it. The spread was nothing like I've seen before. Internet connection was free which was very useful. I had a great view of both the Hancock Tower and Lake Michigan.I will definitely go back to the Four Seasons the next time I'm visiting Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",

Wonderful experience for two adults and a &quot;tween.&quot; I highly recommend the package that allows you to get the ice cream man to come to your room! My son loved it.We had a room with a view overlooking Michigan Avenue, Oak Street beach and the Hancock.Great for walking to shops and the Hancock to see the Christmas train set up, etc. Seasonal lights along Michigan Avenue were nice to see from our window as well.Pool was a little chilly...but fine once you got in. Hot tub was great. Never really crowded at all (!). Easy access from our room to the pool.I would recommend this for families who want to be close to tourist attractions (including American Girl Place) and nearby shops. We were there right before Christmas and it was delightful.\\t\\n\",\n",

I ordered a premium gin, a little dirty, with blue cheese olives. Here we are, in this prestigious hotel expecting to be treated to an excellent beverage. What we got was a sub-par martini, and it did not have olive juice in it (that is what makes it &quot;dirty&quot;). So my order was wrong - but this is the kicker. The waiter came over, acknowledged the mistake, and instead of bringing me a fresh drink proceeded to dump an ounce or two of olive juice directly into my drink. This nasty concoction was supposed to be my 'best in Chicago martini'??? My husband and I laughed about it - but really.... if I'm going to pay $13 for a premium liquor martini in a four star hotel, shouldn't I at least get a fresh drink if the first one is incorrectly made? Shame on you, 4 Seasons! I hope people read this and realize that they should proceed with caution in their lounge! I guess they can all order the $8 Bud Light instead....\\t\\n\",\n",

We spent the night at the hotel after our wedding and it was absolutely perfect. As soon as we arrived, the bellman took our bags and got them up to our room. We have a flawless check in and check out. We ordered a wonderful breakfast the next morning (a bit pricy, but well worth the splurge!) The room service attendant set up our table next to the window, which overlooked Michigan Ave! The room was spotless, the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in and by far the most impeccable service I've ever received.A perfect end to our fairy tale wedding - I only wished we could have stayed longer, one night was not enough.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 23 2008 \\tFive Stars All the Way\\tMy husband and I just returned from a weekend at the Four Seasons Chicago (our second this year) and it was everything one could ask for in a hotel. The staff is professional and friendly, almost always addressing us by name. I really can't say enough about them. One concierge, Christian, was especially helpful. When we remarked on the cookies and lemonade that they have at check-in in the afternoon, he offered to get us some, even though it was not yet noon. My husband asked if he could get the recipe because he bakes as a hobby. Sure enough, later that afternoon, the handwritten recipe appeared under our door after a call from Christian. But he didn't stop with this. Later that day, a carafe of lemonade and a dozen cookies were delivered to our room along with a note from Christian. This is what truly sets the Four Seasons apart. I have stayed at the Peninsula, but it just doesn't quite have that extra touch, so I will always return to the Four Seasons. We also treated ourselve to tea in the lounge this time. I would highly recommend that people try this at least once. We added the champagne for an extra special treat. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone for a wonderful stay in Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Jun 7 2008\\tGeneralized decline\\tSpent two nights at this property, on business/pleasure. Deluxe executive suite 44th floor, facing west. Nicely appointed room, typical 4 Seasons decor (getting a little tired, IMHO). The room had a very unpleasant odor- I asked the maid about it; she shrugged her shoulders.The shoulder shrug pretty much sums up the housekeeping services at this property: unbelievably indifferent. The room was hardly cleaned up during our stay: plenty of stuff on the floor, only partial replacement of the towels, complete lack of attention to details. This is not acceptable at these prices (or, historically, in any 4 Seasons property I've ever stayed at).Front desk folks were great, very helpful. Valets were curt and grudgingly helpful. Pool and workout facilities were very nice. Free wireless internet!If I'm going to spend this much money, I am definitely going to stay at the Peninsula down the street, a vastly superior property with a consistently higher level of service. Although I haven't written a review of the Pen (I'll get around to it one of these days), I have stayed there at least six times; it is, IMHO, one of the finest three hotels in the world.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 28 2008\\tBrilliant\\tIn short, this place is unbelievably good. All hoteliers should send their staff to The Four Seasons for a night or two just to see how great unobtrusive yet attentive service should be done. It would be money well spent.We have just returned from spending three nights in one of the hotel's deluxe executive suites and loved every minute. The staff are trained to perfection and the attention to detail is superb in every regard. The food is excellent. The suite was breathtaking, especially given the views from the 41st floor of Lake Michigan.I could happily move in and never leave.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 25 2008 \\tRefined luxury\\tWe spent a wonderful Memorial Day weekend at the Four Seasons Chicago. The hotel occupies 20 or so floors of a 50-story building at the top of the Magnificent Mile, just 2 blocks west of Lake Shore Drive. The location is very convenient, not only to the typical tourist spots of Michigan Avenue, but also walkable to the less-touristy but more enjoyable neighborhoods of Lincoln Park, Old Town, and Clyburn. The hotel lobby is somewhat stuffy- feels a bit more Boston than Chicago. But the room itself was very comfortably appointed in light earth tones. As expected at the Four Seasons, all the amenities, from the sheets to the bath soaps, were top-of-the-line. We had a wall of windows with an unobstructed view of Lake Michigan. The hotel has a good gym with a pool and steamroom. Only concern with the pool is that it is kept too warm to swim laps, but the fitness center was better than most hotel gyms. We had breakfasts at the on-site restaurant, which was also excellent. Above all, the service was superb. Michelle, the assistant concierge, offered terrific advice and was extremely helpful in securing reservations and planning our itinerary. When I return to Chicago, I will not hesitate to stay at the Four Seasons again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"May 13 2008 \\tWhat more can you expect from a hotel? World class!\\tI've just spent a week-end in Chicago wih my fiance, and as it was a special occasion I decided to pamper her (and myself) at the Hotel Four Seasons Chicago. Wow... What else could I say?From the very moment you arrive, you're treated with all the due respect that you would like to receive from a 5 stars hotel. Suitcases were delivered fastly to our lovely, 44th-storey superior room; check-in was nice and pleasant, and here you can really see how they are able to anticipate your needs!The room was awesome (be sure to require a lake view room at the time of booking - you won't regret it!), right in front of the John Hancock Center! The bed was one of the most comfortable I've encountered so far! Every amenity you can desire from a room was there, including L'Occitane bath amenities.Even for being one of the smallest rooms of the hotel, it was very spacious by other hotels' standards!We had the Mother's Day Brunch at the Seasons restaurant. Just one word: lovely! The lady I emailed with in order to reserve the table (Diane Regan) seemed genuinely happy to meet me and she asked me how the journey from Italy had been!Food selection at the Brunch was amazing, probably second only to the one of the Four Seasons Bangkok! I loved the potato salad topped by quail egg! Or the crab legs! Or the awesome ravioli with tomato sauce and pesto! And what about the incredible asian selection? Just YUMMY!As it was a special occasion, I booked a couple massage at the hotel's spa. Well, this spa is celebrated as one of the best in town, and I could see why! Everything was perfect, and the massage was great, very professional! We have been offered champagne at the end of it too. Great! The swimming pool comes with adjacent jacuzzi and it's very classy. There's a steam sauna and a sauna. Yo ucan find every amenity possible in the spa, really, includng a relaxation room with free drinks, fruits and newspapers!I booked a &quot;Just the two of us&quot; package, which came with champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries. Adorable! They were deliverd to our room exactly at the time I had requested to, as well as the bouquet of roses I ordered!And this package came with in-room midwest breakfast too, which was really, truly phenomenal!I could stay here hours explaining how good this hotel was, but I don't want to ruin you the surprise of thi magnificent hotel right on the Magnificent Mile.Surely, one of the very top hotels in Chicago and in the whole USA, a truly 5 stars hotel!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 5 2008\\tYou call that room service?\\tWe stayed here for a night in May 2008 to celebrate our anniversary. It was great overall if I discounted the negatives associated with our room service experience. Our corner room (18 tier) had a great Michigan avenue (south) view as well as an incredible (western) sunset view. We live in Chicago and could even see our home from this vantage point. Unfortunately room service failed miserably. When we arrived on Saturday we ordered a late afternoon snack. It came up cold and terribly overcooked. Because we were hungry we ate most of it anyway. We forgot to call for cleanup and later headed to dinner and a show. Much to our suprise when we returned to our room the mess was stil there. It was quite clear that we had finished the food. The turn down service had happened but they chose to ignore the mess. Since it was quite late we decided to put the plates and mess in the hallway. I called down and alerted room service about the new hallway mess. They apologised and told me that someone would be dispatched to pick up the remains immediately. When we awoke on Sunday we noticed that our remains had not been picked up. I assumed that the individual who dropped off our breakfast would take care of it. He also chose not to address this mess. It sat there for another hour. It was quite the Holiday Inn look!I had been reminded at check in that we had a $70 food credit for breakfast. We placed our order on Sunday morning. The food was presented right on schedule. They missed one item but we ignored this small issue. This time the food was prepared much better. Parts were cold but overall it was good. They did not presnet a check with the service. When we checked out later that morning the bill included an overage charge of $16. Apparently our light breakfast was $86. That was way overpriced.My belief is that the Four Seasons Chicago is a great porperty. If you have the chance, book the room! The location, views, and people who work there are great. Christian at the Front Desk and the woman with glasses at the Conciegere desk are two that stand out as trememdous ambassadors of the FS Brand. With competition from the Peninsula, Park Hyatt, and Trump, and demand slowing things will have to sharpen slightly to keep the competitive FS advantage. Good travelling!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"May 4 2008 \\tPerfection\\tStayed here last weekend with my mother for free for a work related function. I have nothing but great things to say about it. The hotel and it's entire premises were simply impeccable for the entire stay. The lobby is what you would expect; classic and opulent. The staff were great at check-in. Elevators were fast. We had a superior room facing Lake Michigan on the 33rd floor. We were completely undisturbed the entire stay...rooms were homey and very quiet, I felt very comfortable there. Lighting was superb, bathroom was gorgeous. L'occitane toiletries...love love love! Awesome bedding and turn down service...though the napkin at the foot of the bed was a bit much. I cannot stress enough how fabulous the staff were. Typically I tend to be a low-key traveler and don't bother them, but everyone there was a consummate professional. When we asked about a nearby restaurant, we were immediately reserved a table and transportation arranged; top-notch service from people who know what they are doing. Wireless was fast, free, and worked everywhere it was supposed to. I greatly enjoyed being there and felt perfectly at home. Though the weekend was free; It is certainly worth the price. The level and quality of service is completely up to par.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 4 2008 \\tHad a great experience\\tThis was my second stay at this property. Everything was perfect. The executive suite that I was fortunate enough to have was beautiful. The staff handled ever request promptly and with a smile. The workout facilities were great as were the staff. Room service was prompt and the food excellent. When I called the hotel from the airport to see if I could get a room due to my flight being cancelled they accommodated me without issue. As my checked bags were not returned to me, they provided me with every toiletry necessary. They also provided shorts and a t-shirt to use so that I could work out. The concierge had a charger available for my blackberry and checked the next morning if my flight was on time.This time the Four Seasons got everything right. Being at the hotel was like a home away from home. No matter what the price, it would have been worth it. It was that good.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Apr 16 2008 \\tAbove and Beyond Wonderful\\tHotel website offers $150 to $250 credit to room or hotel credit for spa etc. Wonderful hotel. We upgraded to a suite and had a beautiful view of Michigan Ave. The spa type bathroom was unbelievable. Our room had a jet tub and separate shower. The hotel felt very new. Our room had 2 flat screen tvs and dvd player. I had a massage at the hotel spa and it was wonderful as well. We would definately stay here again. The hotel is located inside the 900 shops which has Bloomingdales, Mark Shale, and many other stores. It is a great location right on Michigan Ave. We asked the concierge how we could get impossible tickets to see OPRAH. They made no promises, but that next day my husband and I were at the OPRAH show! What they do is call the Oprah show and ask for tickets. If there are standby tickets available they will put you on a standby waitlist. You have to be on the list, you can't just go to Harpo to possbily get in. There was room on the wait list so we got on the list and there was seat availability and we got in!!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 14 2008 \\tPerfection in the City\\tFor my first visit to Chicago, I had the great fortune to stay at a truly marvelous hotel. My company was in town for the Kitchen and Bath Show and booked through the convention at a great rate. We also decided to have a reception here for our customers and thus had been in contact with the hotel's catering department. Upon arrival in the pouring rain, umbrellas and smiles greeted us. The hotel is in the perfect shopping area of Michigan avenue in a safe and prime location on top of Bloomingdale's and other stores. The lobby is a short elevator ride up from the street and is the start of the luxury. Marble and crystal are everywhere. At check-in, the desk agent offered us an upgrade to a suite for 30$ more a day. I jumped at the offer and it did not let me down. My room was 4003 on the 40th floor. (btw, even the elevators seem luxurious.) My room was absolutely perfect!! I really can't find a flaw with it. The room consisted of a decent sized living room with desk, sofa, and chair.A large window with windowseat looked out into the fog (As I mentioned, it was raining and nasty outside and the wind was howling.) From what I could see, I could tell that when the rain cleared, my view was going to be fantastic. The adjoining bedroom was large and featured a DIVINE bed and chaise. I was struck by the quality of furnishings and everything looked like it was recently updated. I enjoyed waking up to my own music on the ipod alarm clock that was very easy to set. The dressing area had a bench and mirrors that functioned well for the morning routine. The bathroom was roomy and had marble and good lighting. The L'Occataine products smelled great. The room was perfectly clean!! I use to work in the industry and cleaning perfection is rare if not impossible, but there wasn't the slightest trace of anything amiss in this room. The only thing that I think anyone might complain over is the building noise. Chicago is the windy city and it lived up to it's name that night. As all modern skyscrapers are designed to be flexible in high winds, the Four Seasons has some creaking noises that can be quite noticeable in high winds. It didn't bother me as it reminded me of the rocking of a cruise ship. And the bed kept me cradled and pampered all night long. In the morning, the sun was out and I took in a fantastic view of Lake Michigan and the cityscape including the Hancock Center across the street. The rest of the stay was great including our reception which was handled easily by the great staff. I went to the fitness center which was cozy but had everything I needed. This hotel has to be one of the best I have ever stayed with and I will certainly be back, even if the bank balance can't handle it. Four Seasons has a reputation for the best in the world and this hotel is definitely evidence of that.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 23 2008 \\tGreat experience at the four seasons chicago\\tWhere to begin? Everything about the hotel was amazing. From the beautiful rooms to the breathtaking views, our first four seasons experience was fantastic. Having stayed at many other upscale brands before (mandarin oriental, ritz) we decided to try a four seasons for our trip to chicago and we weren't disappointed in any way.The hotel rooms were spacious and very modern. LCD flatscreens were found both the living room and bedroom. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the large window sill was covered by a cushion that you could relax on with your laptop and enjoy the great views.The staff was equally outstanding. Very polite every time we encountered them and the concierge recommended an outstanding steakhouse (david burkes) that everyone in my family loved.The location was also very nice, sitting right across from the john hancock building on michigan avenue. Curbside at the hotel had lots of heaters that helped tremendously when waiting for a taxi in the 20 degree weather.My first experience with the four seasons chain was outstanding and i've already made plans to stay at the four seasons paris this summer.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mar 20 2008 \\tSuperb hotel\\tHotel exceeded our expectations. We received a warm welcome on arrival, had a superb guest room &amp; enjoyed excellent food &amp; service. Ideally located on the Magnificent Mile, the hotel has superb views over Lake Michigan. A highly recommended place to stay.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Mar 14 2008\\tGreat Experience @ the Four Seasons\\tThere were 7 of us, all friends coming from different locations to reunite for a weekend in Chicago. We had high expectations for a weekend of fun...great food, blues clubs, museums, and relaxing.Thanks to an incredible staff at the Four Seasons, we were able to accomplish all of our objectives!Accommodations: Beautiful rooms, lots of space, and classic Four Seasons hospitality.Spa: We took advantage of the great spa facilities at the hotel. We (the guys in the group) relaxed in the hot tub, used the steam room, and chilled-out before going out each night. The ladies in the group opted to go shopping rather than use the spa facilities :)Concierge Service: Since we had 7 conflicting sources of suggestions for restaurants, museums, and clubs, it was imperative for us to settle our differences by taking the direction of the hotel concierge(s). We had all been inspired by ideas we'd ripped off of the Food Network, Oprah, and other shows, so getting advice from a local was critical. We SCORED with every suggestion made by the concierge staff. Great restaurants, excellent gallery suggestions, and always eager to help (and smile!).The ONE Thing:Every hotel has a different vibe based on the clientele. I've been to many Four Seasons properties...Canada, Argentina, throughout U.S....and each property has a different personality, based on the guest. The guests at this hotel were a bit high-brow and on the snooty side. Before we all went our separate ways (back to San Diego, Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Seattle) we all went into the hotel bar for a good-bye toast. The bartender was annoyed with our request to move two tables together and didn't say one word throughout our time in the bar area...not one word! He walked up to the table, looked at us as we put in our orders, brought the drinks, and gave us a check without a single word! This was the only time we felt a staff member had matched the tone of the clients that frequent the hotel (the other staff members were exceptional).Net-Net:- Great Location- Great Service- A bit of a high-brow vibe (other guests, not staff)- Great for a Chicago weekend getaway!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Mar 10 2008\\tFour Season with Three stars\\tA very nice centally located property. We had a Suite with a really fantastic view of Lake MI. The room had a humidifyer but wasn't working and smelled a bit musty. No in room coffee maker even in a suite! Bathrooms are a bit on the small side for the Four Seasons. Comfy bed. The second day they did not clean our room. My wife called and asked but no one ever showed up. We ate breakfast at Seasons. I ordered corned beef hash which was straight out of a can. Exceedingly expensive even by city standards ($65 for two at breakfast). Lousy coffee. Service was stale with no personality but the dining room is pretty. At check out we had several charges for mini bar items we did not consume. Not a bad stay overall but in this price range there are much better choices. Also on Saturday night they had a wedding reception that was a little out of hand with drinking in the lobby and elevator. Not a dissapointing stay but nothing to ever make me want to return.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mar 2 2008 \\tGrils Just \"Wanna\"have Fun!\\tMyself and 2 girlfriends wanted to indulge in a shopping weekend in Chicago. We are from Canada and decided because of our strong CDN$ that we would do a 3 day weekend of shopping, dining.....and yes, having fun. The 4S for the most part did not disappoint.Check in:On arrival to the hotel, the bellman guided us to the elevator that whisks one up to the hotel lobby which is several floors up. Upon exiting the lift, gracious surroundings await you. Front desk staff was prompt and courteous. We had booked the &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; package for our 3 day stay. Our 1 bedroom suite that we had reserved was not ready.....no problem, we were early and we were hungry. They would contact us when our suite was available. We moved over to the Conservatory where we had a lovely lunch and discussed our upcoming plans. I was contacted by cell that our suite was indeed ready. We went to the front desk and collected our keys and were told that the bellman and our luggage would accompany us to our room. Now here\\'s the glich....Previously,I had phoned and been in direct contact with the hotel regarding the type of suite vs. connecting rooms, etc. that we should secure. Under advisement from hotel reservations (not central ressies) we booked a 1-bedroom suite. Now I am a Type AA traveller that likes to have everything in order. I had preordered a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our suite to kick off our expedition. Imagine my (and my friends) horror when we walked into our suite and I gasped,&quot;Oh my, pink carpet!&quot; Believe me, it got worse. I had specifically asked for a renovated suite and I ended up in a scary, 80\\'s,pink carpetted, stained furniture suite.....at the FOUR SEASONS!! Needless to say, my friends and I wanted to bolt!! Yes, our champagne was waiting, but who felt like indulging?? We apologized to our bellman and told him to take our luggage away, as we would not be staying in this suite. A phone call to the front desk, did NOT deliver, &quot;I am sorry, Dr.XXXX, we will relocate you right away.&quot; Rather, the hotel is fully committed, I am not sure what we can do. Our weekend was not starting out the way that we wanted. One hour later, an associate came up from the front desk to show us 2 options. Weall wanted a separate bed, so offering us 2 king bedded rooms cancelled the first option. The second option was an executive suite beside (not connecting) to a 2nd room. Okay...this will work.Now, apparently there is an upcharge. I am sure the total lookof aghast, prompted them to see what they could do......Thankfully, our rates were left as we were quoted! So, here is the rub. We had just wasted 2 hours of our precious time without husbands and children on room negotiations. NOT the Four Seasons treatment, that I would have expected, but then, Dear Readers, check out my review at the 4S on Lanai (mousey area that prompted inexcusable response from management....I will never ever return there!!!) Okay, so we were checked in. We all took the elevator down to Bloomingdales (which is right below the hotel. Things are looking up :)Suites and Room:Thankfully, freshly decorated and very clean. Linens were lovely. The rooms have a decidely contemporary cool ( i.e. no warmth kind of cool.) Really, absolutely no complaints after our first looksee!! Washrooms were elegant in lovely marble. Robes and slippers and soft jazz greeted us as we were ready to turn in for the evening. Nice.Package:We loved the concierge ladies who assisted with our GJWHF package. Our day at NM with amkeover and personal consultant was fun! We loved our martini man who came one evening to our suite and indulged us with a favourite martini. Nice touch!Location:The hotel commands a great location on Michigan Avenue. We loved that we could shop and bring our treasures back to our suite/room and head back out again. You can\\'t beat Chicago for shopping!!Restaurants/Lounges:Excellant food but sometimes spotty service. Nice music in lounge in the evening.Exercise Facilities:Small, but well appointed and very clean. Managed to get 2 workouts in during our stay.Overall:Would I stay here again? Maybe.... I would certainly check out the rates at the Park Hyatt and compare with 4S. After our rocky start, we did enjoy our stay. Sadly, our first impressions (and my other recent stay in Lanai), will not guarantee that I am a forever loyal 4S client. Happy and safe travels......\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Feb 29 2008 \\tBest hotel experience ever!\\tMy husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons for a valentine's weekend gift to ourselves. We have stayed at some amazing hotels, but we both agreed this was our best hotel experience yet. The service was impeccable. We were in an executive suite overlooking the lake and it was gorgeous. We did NOT want to leave. In fact, we pretty much stayed in the room the entire time just to soak it all in. We waited longer than average for our car from the valet, which was our only annoyance the entire time. I noted this to the manager and they offered a free facial for a future visit. We can't wait to get back!!!\\t\\n\",\n",

We have been to Chicago dozens of times and stayed at many hotels, but The Four Seasons is the BEST! The service, our suite, and amenities were superb. I won the weekend trip from The City of Chicago Tourism Bureau's online contest and was picked from over 17,000 entries. We were treated like royalty and everything was so perfect! We even had a visit from a champagne butler and got a special card and chocolate truffle cupcake delivered to our room, as it was my birthday. To top everything off, we seen Carson Kressley in the lobby as we were leaving! The weekend was truly a memorable one!\\t\\n\",\n",

The last time I stayed for a week with my family, we had a corner suite which was perfect, for me, my wife and the two children, 9 and 13. The restaurant is excellent three of us had the tasting menu two with matching wines. The staff, were very attentive and friendly, looking after us all.The location is perfect just off Michigan Mile and right over a major shopping mall.

The rooms are beautiful and perfectly appointed for total relaxation. It is a pleasure to come back to your room and relax after a work day; it's almost better then home (almost!) The best part is turn down service; when yo leave for dinner, housekeeping tidies up, refreshed your towels, lays out your robe, turns on light jazz music, and turns down your bed. I wish everyday could end like that! Room service food is delicious, and the hotel bar has the best collection of Scotches I've ever seen.\\t\\n\",\n",

We were offered a special rate because of the course -- Still expensive but very nice. I was very impressed by the professionalism of everyone from the bell captains to front desk to spa personnel. This has to be the cleanest hotel I've seen and I never spotted a maid cart once. When we arrived, we were asked if we wanted an upgrade for an executive suite. We took it as it was a very small amount. The room(s) was huge with a gorgeous view of Lake Michigan and Michigan Avenue (the trees were lit on our second night there before the parade). The location was perfect for shopping and restaurants. We had never stayed at a Four Seasons before but definitely will be back.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 3 2007 \\tGreat with kids\\tWe just took our kids (6 &amp; 7) to Chicago for the weekend and picked this hotel because its website promoted its family friendliness. The website was accurate. The hotel was very good with children and there were many nice touches the kids noticed and we appreciated.We stayed in a deluxe executive suite with a view of the lake as requested. The suite was nice with a great, comfortable bed, large bath and a comfortable sofa bed for the kids to share. We booked a kids in the city weekend and the add-ons with it were very useful. Kids could order free off the in-room children's menu. We had dinner one night and breakfast both mornings in the room. The price was high (for the 2 adults), but worth it for the quality of the food (excellent) and the convenience of having some casual meals with the kids. Both afternoons when we came back to the room, treats were left for the girls. When we first arrived, there were cookies and chocolate milk, a board game, crayons and an activity book as well as two kid-sized robes. My kids loved those robes! Also, the hotel arranged a trip from the ice cream man. He arrived at our door with a full cart decked out with ice cream and a dozen topping choices. I'd like to say the museums will be the strongest memory my kids will have of this trip, but in actuality, they'll remember the ice cream man for much longer.The package also had special discounts at local retailers (we only took advantage of the American Girl Place special - a free piece of doll's clothing) and free admission for one child to many local museums (we used several of these and saved over $50). The prices at the Four Seasons are high so we appreciated the little extras that were so thoughtfully included in their rates. Three other notes: 1) The location was excellent right in the midst of the Michigan shopping extravaganza. 2) The pool is another highlight for kids (the adults liked it too). So many city hotels either skip pools entirely, put them in the unattractive, airless sub-basement or link up to a sports club where only lap swimming adults are welcome. The Four Seasons has a lovely, spacious pool on the 8th floor with lots of natural light and a big hot tub. 3) The concierge was extremely helpful, getting us several last minute reservations. All in all, top-notch facility, staff and location.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 11 2007 \\tPredictably Four Seasons and Predictably Good\\tHere for business just for one night and hotel is predictably good for a Four Seasons. Nice location, nice and new renovated rooms (with the flat screen television, nice beds, nice views, etc) as well as a new bathroom. It's not quite the luxury you'd expect of a Four Seasons in a primary urban market (compared to New York or Paris or Hong Kong) but the service was excellent and there really was nothing to complain about at all. People addressed you by name, check-in./check-out was efficient. I don't think it has the cache or reputation of the Peninsula but it's definitely the second best in town.\\t\\n\",\n",

We stayed in one of the suites and it was wonderful. The bed was extremely comfortable. The suite was spacious and very clean. The turn down service was even top of the line. The location of the hotel is excellent and within walking distance of restaurants and lots of shopping. We had drinks in the restaurant and enjoyed the very talented pianist as we relaxed. This is a very classy, quality hotel. We will definitely return!\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Sep 9 2007 \\tFour Seasons - The Best Hotel I have stayed in!\\tI have just returned home from staying in the Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago. My boyfriend and I decided to take a weekend break away. Our expectations were high given the other reviews we had read and the fact that it is a five star hotel and we certainly weren't dissappointed. We booked a superior room and when we arrived we were asked if would like to upgrade to an executive suit at a reduced rate. Tempted by the offer we did just that. The room was lovely and we were very glad that we took the offer to upgrade. The room was was divided into two areas seprated by double doors. There was a lounge area with a sofa and comfy chair and office area in the corner. The bedroom was nicely done and the linen felt so soft on the skin. Each room had a plasma T.V. screen. The bathroom was a decent size with a separate bath (with enough room for two!) and shower area, with a power shower, of course. I suppose all of the above are to be expected from a top hotel, however, I think that what really makes this place great, in my mind, is the service. I am a particularly fussy eater and everytime I called room service to order something that wasn't exactly the on the menu they were extemely accomadating. The staff seemed gueninelly friendly and I got the feeling that they take pride in what they do. I really can't think of anything I can complain about, oh apart from the fact that we paid for the limo service to pick us from the airport and we weren't told that we had to go to a particular meeting place. It meant that we had to wait for about ten mins before someone found us.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 9 2007 \\tComplete luxury and wonderful for families too\\tWe travelled to Chicago (part business, part leisure) with our 3 yrd old daughter.I spent hours researching hotels - when you have a small child and want a luxury hotel, the options are limited. I chose the Four Seasons because it seemed extremely family friendly, but still had all the luxury qualities that my husband and I have become used to during our travels &quot;pre-child&quot; !It was an AMAZING experience. We were offered an upgrade on arrival (for a small fee) to a one bedroom suite (we had booked an executive suite), but upon checking the rooms out, our exec suite was beautiful and had a much better view than the 1-bed bigger room so we kept the smaller one (which was far from small I might add, and overlooked Lake Michigan).With a small child there was plenty of room, and each night we had milk/cookies ready for her before bed.The bar area is gorgeous - if you like old fashioned sumptuous surroundings with accompanying pianist then you will love this place. The staff are amazing and remembered what we like to drink and gave our daughter so much attention - her favourite past-time was dancing next to the piano (and she even sat next to the pianist one night!). Pool is gorgeous and the gym is ok - a bit small, but fine for a few work-outs.Location is superb - next to the beach/loads of restaurants/near Lincoln Park and is on Mag Mile next to Macy's and all the designer boutiques.Don't miss out on the Sunday brunch - we forgot and ate breakfast about 1/2 hour too early in the other dining room - the brunch buffet looked fantastic and if you've got kids they have a supervised Harry Potter actitivity which gives parents an hour or so to themselves.Families will not feel out of place here at all. Although not swarming with kids (thankfully!) there is a good mix of families/business people and couples to make you feel comfortable.All in all an amazing hotel for everyone. We've been to some fab hotels (including the Jumeirah/Burj in Dubai) and this is up there with those.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aug 31 2007\\tFour Seasons Amazing\\tJust stayed at Four Seasons Hotel Chicago, it was amazing. The renovated guest rooms are great. Plasma TV, contemporary decor, great bathrooms and views. The staff is always welcoming and friendly.The meeting space was great as well, had a half day meeting one day and they are on top of service.As normal Four Seasons does an amazing job, and this hotel lives up to the legend.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Aug 20 2007 \\tHIGHLY recommend this hotel\\tDon't hesitate to book your stay here. We were not sure whether this hotel would be worth the price, as sometimes we are disappointed when the service level does not live up to the reputation. The Four Seasons in Chicago had FANTASTIC service, wonderful rooms, beautiful views, perfect location, and a great wine list. I recommend staying at this property, and will make sure we stay here on every visit to Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 15 2007 \\tVery beautiful hotel\\tWe booked the Four Seasons in Chicago based on the reputation of the hotel chain. Four Seasons stands for quality and service extraordinaire. We were not disappointed at all. The hotel is beautifully decorated. It is very luxurious with beautiful antique furniture. We stayed for the Canadian long weekend in August and our stay was perfect. We arrived at 9am on Friday morning &amp; had requested an early check-in. Of course, our room was not available. But, they allowed us to change in the spa and safely stored our bags. We gave them our cell number &amp; they called us when the room was ready which was around 2ish. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite on the 32nd floor. It was a newly renovated room with a lovely view of Lake Michigan. We had maid service twice daily and bottled water delivered to our room in the afternoon. The hotel lobby is on the 7th floor. In the lobby they served coffee in the morning and ice cold fresh squeezed lemonade in the afternoon. Floors 1 thru 6 house Bloomingdale's department store and many other high-end boutique style stores. You are conveniently located at the corner of Michigan Avenue (magnificent mile). The hotel is at the very start of the mile so you can walk up and down both sides of the street and not miss a store. I would highly recommend this hotel. You will not be disappointed if you stay at the Four Seasons in Chicago!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jul 15 2007 \\tOK but nothing special\\tGenerally, I am a big fan fo Four Seasons properties and while there are no serious issues, there is nothing that special either. Check-in is smooth, efficient and everything that one might expect of the Four Seasons. The desk staff are to be comended for their efficiency as well as their ability to tailor their discussion with guests (eg first time visitor versus business traveler). The lobby is rather unimpressive and could well be a part of a Sheraton or similar mid-line brand. Specifically, the furnishings are mixed and matched and appear to be part of a re-do in process. Floral arrangements are very impressive however.Rooms are fine and the bathrooms very lovely with L'Occitane products. One feature that I really liked in the rooms was the static guard spray. Very nice touch. The bar area is pleasant, and the service nice but really better for a quick business drink rather than anything social. Overall, I would recommend staying at The Peninsula if I wanted a spectacular over the top experieice, with great food spa and service (recently ranked #1 hotel in America by Conde Nast) or Park Hyatt if I wanted excellent service and a good bar.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 27 2007 \\tOne night was not enough!\\tMy experience of this hotel was fantastic. I had a deluxe room, and the room size was above average. Room furnishing and equipment was also very good and up-to-date, with plasma tv, large, modern bathroom, desk, bench seat in window and the most comfortable hotel bed that I have ever slept in! Would have stayed and caught a few more zzz's but for the early morning conference all I had to make.But when I did wake up, what a great view of the lake and the rising sun from the large window of my 45th floor room.Everything about this hotel left me wanting to go back again. Good location for the shops, stunning flower arrangements throughout the reception, and very pleasant staff.I was lucky enough to be travelling on business, but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here out of my own pocket as have stayed in much pricier hotels of an inferior standard.Well done the Four Seasons!\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jun 15 2007\\tGreat Hotel! ***** 5 stars\\tI stayed two nights at the Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago for an investor conference (that was held in the hotel) in May, and this is clearly a great hotel.This is a &quot;big city&quot; Four Seasons hotel, with an older, more conservative, formal decor, as opposed to the modern look of the Four Seasons in Manhattan. As in most Four Seasons, the service was impeccable, from the doorman, to check-in, to the concierge, to the service in the restaurant.The room was nice and spacious, with a large bathroom, nice robes, and comfortable beds, pillows, and bed linens. There was a very nice spa and fitness center with good cardiovascular equipment and some weight equipment. Food and service in the restaurant (for dinner) was very good. One of the best things about the stay was the price. I felt like I was in a 5 star New York hotel, but prices were about 60% of the prices in New York. I have high standards when in a 5-star hotel, this hotel lived up to all of them.\\t\\n',\n",

       " \"May 16 2007 \\tChicago's Finest; Renovation Nearly Complete\\tThe Four Seasons Chicago is superb in every way, particularly after a multi-million renovation (which is still in progress).The Four Seasons, not to be confused with the Ritz-Carlton Chicago managed by the Four Seasons Company, is situated on Chicago's famous Michigan Avenue. The location could not be better, as it's just steps from the major shopping districts of Chicago, and easily accessible to various financial centers, restaurants and the John Hancock building.The hotel occupies floors 32-46, with the lobby situated above street level. Until the renovations are complete, some common areas and guest rooms will still reflect the classic style, but once complete, this property will exude a tasteful contemporary Four Seasons motif throughout.The service was exacting throughout, with an incredible degree of warmth. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed pleasantly, in true Four Seasons form. Upon check-in, we were notified that we had been blocked in a newly renovated deluxe guest room, with a lake view. I had not had the opportunity to stay in this property previously, but I was quite pleased with the renovation. New furnishings were very tastefully selected, along with a designer bathroom. Most impressive however was the bed comfort; perhaps the very best I've had in a hotel. I travel very frequently, but never have I been so impressed by a hotel bed!The gym and spa area were terrific, and incredibly spacious. For a hotel of this size, I have rarely seen so many machines (all new) If you demand an impressive fitness center, this is your hotel.The Four Seasons Chicago will afford you a quiet, contemporary hotel central to all of Chicago's famous attractions, with excellent service. Regardless of your occasion, this hotel is certain to satisfy all of your expectations.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 8 2007 \\tEverything I expected\\tOur stay at the Four Seasons was spectacular. We were upgraded to a spacious suite with two large flat screen TVs. One of the concierges, Michelle, was very helpful and saved us from near disaster when Janponais lost our dinner reservation. She also helped us find a rental car when the local Enterprise was sold out. Drawbacks: it was annoying to take two elevators to get to the room and as my wife said, &quot;I prefer the robes at the Ritz.&quot;\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Apr 7 2007 \\tGreat location and service\\tThe location of the hotel is great and our room was very well-designed and luxurious. The entrance to the hotel is rather inconvenient and annoying as you have to take two elevators. The staff are helpful but very impersonal and they seem somewhat overextended.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jan 29 2007\\tFantastic service\\tWe had a fantastic time recently at the Four Seasons. The meals were top notch as was the service. Their concerige goes above and beyond to recommend iteneraries to suit all ages. We went with my elderly parents and got great seats tickets to some theatre and they organised an architectural boat tour which was spectacular.\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Jan 20 2007\\tAverage experience\\tI stayed in a spacious room on the 38th floor with view on the lake. Interior decoration and bathroom were old fashioned and in need of touch up. I wanted to rest before a meeting in the early afternoon, but this was not possible because of renovation work noise coming from the upper floor. I complained and the answer was essentially that from 9 am to 5 pm renovation work noise is allowed. Room change was offered, but I did not consider it, because the next day I would have been out for work during that period. I do not think that giving me a room with renovation work noise and then offering a room change is a behaviour coherent with common hospitality principles.Stunning flower arrangements and abundance of staff are not sufficient to leave a good remembrance of a hotel.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Dec 1 2006\\tExcellent Service\\tExcellent Quality and service. exactly what you expect from the Four Seasons! Guest services always knew your name, and they were very prompt in meeting any requests! Hotel staff was wonderful, and the room was excellent! Couldn't have asked for a better hotel in Chicago!\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Aug 15 2006 \\tGood Value Average Experience\\tI live in Chicago - and, from time-to-time, stay downtown at luxury hotels to enjoy all that the City has to offer. This time, I made the mistake of staying at the Four Seasons. The rate was very fair - $330 for a deluxe king room on the 45th floor. The room, however, was in need of a make-over. I requested a non-smoking room. And, at check-in, was assured that I was in a non-smoking room on a floor with some smoking rooms. When I opened the room door, it smelled like a mixture of cheap perfume and ashtrays. When I complained to the front desk, they offered to move me into a standard room on a low floor with a worse view. So, I decided to deal with the smell to experience the larger room on a higher floor with a great view. The bathroom was in need of a complete renovation. The fixtures have to be from the 1960's. The furniture was worn, scratched and dented. Most of all, the room technology was below poor. In what is supposed to be one of the most luxurious hotels in the United States, I found one, old 25 inch tube TV and no DVD player in the room. There was no wireless technology to access the Internet. Finally, when I called room service and asked them to recommend a champagne selection (the beverage menu was missing from our room), they only provided me with two choices (a bottle of Dom at $285 and a bottle of Veuve at just under $100). I couldn't believe this poor service from a hotel that is supposed to have a &quot;champagne butler&quot; to assist with the selection. In sum, I got a good rate - but, for that rate, I stayed in a smoke-smelling, run down, technology-bare room. And, the one time that I requested help from a staff member, I received mediocre service. I would definitely skip this location until they upgrade it and stay down the street at the Peninsula.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 22 2006 \\tStay at the Peninsula\\tThis is the Four Seasons people; it should be perfect, but it is average. The common areas are nice enough, but the rooms are really old. I pay over $700 a night and am watching TV on a 25-inch picture tube??? Why is the bathroom sink so old it makes me feel like I am stuck in the 60's? Why is the room service food reminiscent of a Hilton instead of Jean Georges? FS is getting by on brand name in this disappointing hotel. I stayed at the Peninsula two weeks prior and was wowed by the brand new rooms with all the bells and whistles that you expect from a $500+ five star hotel, and the lobby is nicer.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 6 2006\\tLovely except for the noisy children\\tI had been in town on business on Chicago and was looking forward to a relaxing afternoon at the Four Seasons Spa, which came highly recommended by a friend from Chicago. I purchased a day pass and had an hour Swedish massage, and also ordered lunch to be brought in to me. The Positives: the dry sauna, the steamroom, the large towels, the accessible lockers and huge showers with all the amenities, the prompt luncheon service, the staff (very, very kind...too much so...see below), the eucalyptus-scented cool hand towels for after sauna/steamroom, the pool, the food, the variety of beverages in the pool area, the massage (EXCELLENT) and the fact that the Spa area is located on its own floor in relation to this large hotel so you are not bumping into hotel guests. The Negatives: This is my big peeve. And please don't get me wrong....I love children. However, there is a time and place for them, particularly in an upscale spa. I did not at all mind the children who were guests of the hotel having access to the pool, which is seperate from the Spa, Sauna, Steamroom and Showers/Locker Area. They were loud, as small (ranging in age from 2 to 10) children will be at swimming pools and did not mind this so much due to the fact that the lounge area for the pool where the juices and teas were located were seperated by a glass wall. I was however, VERY perturbed at the mommies who were seemingly oblivious to their noisy, loud, spoiled children running around the Spa area grabbing magazines and spilling juices unsupervised in areas they were not to be permitted. One child, about 8 years old, was dumping tea bags on the floor for fun. Mommy could see this child through the window and did nothing. I understood the Four Seasons Spa to be &quot;child-free&quot; except in the pool area. The staff knew the children were running around the Spa area and did nothing about it, perhaps out of fear of the mommies. They definitely turned a blind eye, and I can state definitively that these mommies and their children were not of any relation to anyone who owns the Ritz-Carlton group.At any rate, the relaxation of my massage quickly disappeared due to the children allowed in the spa area. If you luck out, you will visit on a day when children are truly not allowed in an area meant for adults who mean to relax. But do not count on the staff to handle it. I will try the Penisula Spa next trip.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jun 3 2006\\tstay in old fashion style\\tStayed in a lovely suite on 31st floor. Saw that earplugs was provided but as it was not windy at all I did not experience the problems other reviewers have mentioned. The interior of the suite was oldfashioned and very pretty but yes one could also see that FS is in need of some touch up.I had breakfast in room and the service was vey good. The pool and gym facilities was excellent and I was lucky to find friendly helpful staff when needed.What else? Stunning flower arrangements in the public areas and very helpful concierge. As Chicago is one option for me to move to due to work I found the information they gave me very helpful.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"May 15 2006\\tVery nice hotel...but not totally FS experience\\tWe were at the Four Seasons Chicago last weekend...The public areas are BEAUTIFUL, flowers everywere and the staff very friendly and helpful.We had drinks at the bar, and ate at the light asian table and everything was fine... one day we had lunch at the restaurant and the food and service was excellent.Our room was in the 36th floor with a nice view of the lake... the room was very comfortable with nice decoration, however it does not look like a regular Four Season's room, it is a little &quot;old world&quot; style.We used the spa services and installations (incl. pool)... the service was good, sometimes I was looking for help and there were nobody, I had to go to the spa reception to get help with the steam room, to get body lotion, that was weird because you see lots of people working and a second later, nobody.In genera, we had a good time, will go back again, but since we have been in several FS, I'm sure that the rooms need to be at the FS standards (even that the rooms are nice).\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Apr 3 2006\\tNot recommended\\tAfter staying at many Four Seasons properties over the years, including this particular Chicago location at least a dozen times, I have finally realized that this hotel desperately needs an overhaul. The lobby is gorgeous, the staff is generally accommodating and professional, the restaurants are certainly above average and the location is ideal. Also, there is an elegant complimentary coffee/tea service set up in the reception area each morning. This hotel had become a comfortable, familiar place to stay. However, after my most recent experience, I feel it no longer meets the impeccable standards of the Four Seasons. I had requested a room with 2 beds, and upon checking in, I immediately noticed that the room was quite dreary, although as with most of the rooms, the view was amazing. Carpeting worn, and there was a gap in the floor across the length of the room that had been carpeted over. The headboard banged against the wall, as it was not attached to anything; there was a lampshade on the desk that was about 3 sizes too large for the base; the vinyl backing to the draperies was ripped, worn and yellowed, and there was some unsightly mold/dust in one area where the wall met the ceiling. I called to request a room change, mainly because of the headboard, and they promptly moved me to a similar room, which was an improvement. I also want to mention, the clerk who assited me at the front desk was quite brusque. I was surprised, since most front desk personnel are usually most gracious and polite.That evening, due to high winds, our walls were creaking so loudly, we could barely hear the TV...and I am not exaggerating! I have heard these sounds in the past, but not to this extent. My daughter and I left for a few hours just to get away from the noise. Upon checkout the next morning, when asked how our stay was, I mentioned we barely slept due to the noise in our room from the walls creaking all night, so we were tired and did not enjoy our stay this time. The desk clerk half-heartedly apologized, but that was about it. This particular hotel does not maintain or operate under the Four Seasons standards of excellence. There are far too many choices of great hotels in Chicago, to be bothered and annoyed with accommodations and service like this.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Mar 7 2006\\tFabulous service\\tI do not understand all the negative reviews of this hotel. When I arrived, I was upgraded to a suite with fantastic views. Every single member of staff was charming and helpful and always used/remembered my name. The room was absolutely silent at night. I admit that it wasn't as new as the Peninsula but it had every amenity that you could possibly want/need and was nicely decorated. Of the public areas, the lounge was lovely (try afternoon tea, it's great) and the pool was beautiful. If you are there over a weekend, book for brunch on the Sunday - it is amazing and relatively good value for what you get.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dec 22 2005\\tDisappointing - needs renovating\\tStayed here on business and chose if over the peninsula since it was slightly more reasonable. Not a good decision. The common parts are quite grand but the rooms are small and very dated. The bathroom, in particular, is not up to four seasons standards with i) no double sinks and ii) no separate stall shower (you shower in the tub). In addition, the fixtures look like they are out of the 1970s. The room was quite small, sparsely decorated and had no wireless internet access. The view of the lake was definitely the best thing going for it. I did not sample the food so cannot comment on that. Staff was courteous.Another reviewer pointed out that the hotel is noisy and creaks. I too experienced this and it woke me up several times during the night. It is a bizarre sensation hearing the building creaking around you! Overall, relative to other Four Seasons I have stayed at, this hotel was very disappointing and more akin to a 4 star than 5 star hotel.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Nov 17 2005\\tExcellent hotel with one major drawback\\tThis hotel was everything I imagined it would be with beautiful rooms and accomodations and very friendly service, until it was time to sleep. The walls on each side of the room creeked like an old wooden floor all night long. They say it's due to the wind and they provide earplugs, but nothing can block out this constant noise. It was miserable and we didn't sleep much at all. On the second night we found a humidifier which helped a little, but for Four Seasons, this was disappointing. I can't imagine this is the case in all the rooms, but hopefully you don't have the same bad luck we did.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 20 2005 \\tPerfect for any Season\\tSpring, Summer, Winter or Fall the Four Seasons Chicago is in a class all by itself.I recently stayed there on business while in Chicago. From the very first &quot; Oh Hello, Mrs. C. we have been expecting you&quot; ...to the &quot;Goodbye Mrs. C. we will look forward to seeing you again&quot; the entire experience was heavenly. It is obviously no accident the staff is well trained, polite, professional -without the slightest hint of stuffiness and &quot;No&quot; is just not in their vocabulary. The rooms are spotless, airy, spacious, elegantly appointed and oh so comfortable. I was upgraded to a Jr. suite on the 34th floor. My room was on a corner with huge windows on all sides with a beautiful view of the city. The single most impressive thing about my beautiful room was not the fabulous bed or two tv's or even three telephones or lightening fast internet connection...it was the complete silence of the room. I know for a fact the hotel was sold out for my entire stay but honestly I did not hear a single sound ...not a door slam, toliet flush, siren, honking horn...nothing absolute pure exquisite silence.Magically, my ice bucket was constantly filled to the brim with fresh ice and when I indulged in popcorn and Orangina from the mini bar they were mysteriously replaced the very same day. I was busy and needed to work on my computer and because of the comfort of the room decided to spend more time at the hotel and I can honestly say with the exception of venturing to Seasons for high tea, I ate every meal from room service in my room. High tea is an experience all of its own. I was dining alone and felt a little uncomfortable but any reservations I had were quickly dispelled when I was kindly given a beautiful small table with a breathtaking view and offered a variety of newpapers.  As I pretended to read my paper and munched on an assortment of cucumber sandwiches and deviled eggs, I felt like the Queen of England without the hat and gloves. The only difficult decison I had to make was dessert so I had three small divine ones. In Room dining was wonderful; quick, hot and delicious and served very professionally.My entire experience was delightful. You simply can't go wrong with this beautiful, elegant hotel. It's a true jewel in the Windy City.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 4 2005\\tFive Diamond Urban Midwestern Disneyland-Type Atmosphere\\tI've been a client of this hotel for 11 years (basically since it opened). I'm sad to see it recently transform from a tranquil urban oasis of fine accomodations, amenities, facilities and service into a glorified miswestern urban Disneyland-type atmosphere, overrun with screaming families, whose children repeatedly slam doors, throw things to the floor and create a general cacophony that can be heard even in corner rooms. If that's what you're looking for, then you will love this place and should make it your home away from home. But, if you're an adult on serious business or a couple looking to escape for a few nights, stay at the Peninsula instead-- that's where I'm staying next time.First off, if you're looking for a good swim or relaxing soak, forget about the pool and hot tub (and even locker rooms). Each time I came down to the pool, there were at least 4 children in the hot tub (hot water and kids equals you know what) and another 6-10 in the pool (ibid). On a previous stay, the pool had actually been closed for a day because someone's child made a mess in there. Don't even bring your bathing suit or goggles unless you plan to use them in your own bathtub. On my latest visit, I detected the stench of urine in one of the showers-- this was a first for me at this hotel and it is what ultimately motivated me write this review.The gym is pretty well equipped and I did get in a decent workout, but I wasn't able to swim because the pool was so overrun, nor did I use the hot tub after my workout because of the same reason. I even decided to shower up in my room because of the aforementioned problem in the locker room.As for the rooms, some other reviewers have mentioned that the decor looks dated and worn. I don't think so. The fact that the rooms are still original decor doesn't bother me-- I think they are very nice and have excellent views. Yes, the TV's are kind of old but they work fine and are well placed. The bathrooms are meticulously maintained. However, the room above us must have had 5 children in it, with the kids banging the doors, walls, screaming at the top of their lungs at all hours, early AM and PM, which prevented us from really unwinding-- the only quiet times were when the cacophanous family above us was out of their room. Housekeeping is excellent, room service is great, and the concierge staff is very good. It's still a five diamond hotel, but a more accurate description would be a five diamond urban midwestern Disneyland type atmosphere.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 29 2005\\tYuk!! Crawling with Kids \\tWe love this chain and have stayed at other Four Season Hotels. However, we couldn't believe how bad this one was. Kids screaming and running around everytime we entered the hotel. All public areas were smoking areas. Empty cigarette wrappers were left on the tables. A group of 6 or so ten-year old little girls(unsupervised) were playing with make-up in the public bathrooms. They were still there when I came back a half hour later. Kids running in the halls. We have children ourselves and do not let them roam unsupervised in a hotel.Our room had not been vacuumed. Dried cereal was on the carpet by the bathroom. Pieces of food were under the bedside table. Ear plugs were provided by the hotel to block the noisy mechanicals. My luggage was lost by the bell caps even though it contained 2 luggage tags plus the Four Seasons tag. Our floor was subject to unannounced security sweeps which were never explained.We are world travelers who stay in all type of places from low to high price ranges. We understand inconveniences. This hotel does not deserve the Four Seasons name.\\t\\n\",\n",

We had a great view of Lake Michigan. The rooms and furnishings were very nice, and the location was good - right around the corner from Michigan Avenue. The gym/spa was outstanding. The locker room had dry and wet saunas. Freshly squeezed orange juice was available along with fresh fruit and some other juices. The indoor pool was nice, although a bit small. (My kids made sure that they did cannonballs in the pool - imitating a scene from Home Alone II which had been filmed at the same pool.) We didn't eat at the hotel. Grabbed a drink at the bar which was fine. Free internet access was available at the business center.  Service was excellent. Bag handling, check-in and check-out was very efficient. The concierge was always helpful and friendly. Housekeeping was very quick and could be scheduled at your convenience. Incidentals included complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning, lemonade in the afternoon. The kids got free popcorn and Cokes upon arrival. You can choose between the NY Times and one of the Chicago newspapers for delivery to your room. As part of the turndown service they provided complimentary bottles of water and earplugs. (Not sure why they provide the earplugs - we didn't have any problems with noise.) Overall, we thought that it was a great hotel. We would definitely be interested in staying here again if we return to Chicago.\\t\\n\",\n",

There was popcorn and mini cokes in the room when we arrived. They prepared an awesome bubble bath for the kids with lots of toys and and the Sundae man came to our room and made the kids awesome Sundaes.

The kids loved it and it is very family friendly!\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Apr 10 2005\\tYes it needs a renovation\\tWe choosed the Four Seasons Chicago for a four day week-end in March 2005, because we are fans of this chain. The location was perfect on the Magnificient Mile: the service was excellent; the breakfast and lunch were very good; the room (it was an upgrade) had a magnificient view of the lake and the city; we even had windows that opened to bring fresh air into the room.But this hotel is dated: the room was small for a deluxe room; the TV was tiny, the carpets were used, the decor was old fashioned, and the bath/shower were not up to Four Seasons standarts. A major renovation is planned for 2006. Next time, we will try the Peninsula, even if we will not get the view of the Four Seasons.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Mar 28 2005\\tVery pleased with the Four Seasons\\tWe stayed just one night (March 24, 2005), because this was a last minute trip, however, we were very pleased with our stay at the Four Seasons in Chicago.My husband and I were traveling with our two sons (6 and 9) and we were so pleased with how family-friendly this hotel was! When we arrived, they had two freshly baked cookies and ice cold milk waiting for the boys. After a long day, this was so nice for them. We also took advantage of the &quot;Kids in the City&quot; package which allows children to eat free room service and entitles you to discounted shopping and museum tickets. If you are traveling with children, you definately want to take advantage of this!Our room was clean and spacious with a large parlor area, a bedroom with french doors and a large bath with separate tub and shower. Everything was very clean. Bed was very comfortable with feather pillows and comforters.The pool and fitness areas, which have well-appointed locker rooms and showers, are wonderful and clean. We didn't have time to take advantage of the spa, but a lot of other people did so. The staff was very courteous and we felt very pampered. We definately would go back!\\t\\n\",\n",

The studios are depressing because they are small, dark, and seedy though clean. There was no outlet I could use for my laptop in the studio either. The one bedroom is much better in every respect but it is still not a place I'd want to spend much time. I wanted a kitchen so that I would have the option of cooking some meals instead of dining out, but the coffee maker had a corroded cord that was an electrical fire waiting to happen. The location is great but the one elevator can take a very long time. You get what you pay for here. It's cheap but not a bargain.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mar 3 2003\\tDelaware Towers/Delaware Inn Review\\tWhile the Delaware Towers, or as it is called on the outside of the hotel, Delaware Inn offers a discounted rate, it is far from the three stars that you will see it advertised. It is in a safe neighborhood with much shopping within walking distance. I found this to be suitable if you are not going to spend much time in the room or hotel. The queen size bed pulls out from the wall and the space is very small. I found the bathrooms to be a bit dirty and the faucets had leaks, but from what I hear they are slowly trying to renovate. I would give this hotel about a 1-2-star rating at the present state it is in. While the hotel staff was helpful in assisting with check in, they were not very knowledgable about the city of Chicago. All in all, it is not a bad place considering the price, but it is not as comfortable as they make it out to be.\\t\\n',\n",

Although a little dated it was a bargain we had a suite with a bedroom with kingsize bed, bathroom, kitchen with full oven and fridge freezer and a large Diner/lounge with dining table settee and chairs a desk and cable TV. The situation was excellent close to many attaractions, shopping centres, cinema and around the corner from a Underground Station.There was a bonus of a minimarket less than 100yds away. We stayed in May and paid $78.00 per night for the room plus tax!! It is on the same road as 4 star hotels a safe area with many restaurants close by\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Jul 7 2009 \\tWORST HOTEL EVER!!!! Guaranteed to make your skin crawl!!!\\tThis is without a dirt the nastiest hotel/motel/inn that I have ever stayed in. Fist of all, when walking in, you can taste the cancer in the air! (That is how thick the smell of cigarette smoke is!) I should have known not to stay there when after checking in, the worker gave me the key to my room AND THE REMOTE TO THE TV!!! LOL We put our stuff down in the room and left immediately to get some dinner, as it was quite late. Upon returning, we get into the dim-lit room which had the furnishings of a one-night-stand stop. That includes a chewed piece of bubble gum in the shower, torn bath towels, a tray and ice bucket labeled from the Ramada hotel and soap bars from Super 8 Motel!! Not sure how they got those items, because I would bet my life that they don't have an agreement with any of those groups. I decided that I might just be very picky, and we decided to get some sleep since we were both very tired from our flight. But once we pulled back the blanket and found curly hair on the sheets and the pillow cases, I decided that I could not stay there, especially with my girlfriend. At 2 a.m. while waiting to speak with the attendant at the front desk, I was able to overhear a pleasant conversation where a respectable customer rents a room for the &quot;four hour special&quot; of $50. Upon doing so, his male friend enters followed by 2 very short and very plump ladies, and then off they all were to have what I can only figure to be a very quiet night of sleep, because what else would they be doing in a hotel room for 4 hours? Now to think that my girlfriend and I would be sleeping in the same bed as some guy who rented the room for 4 hours, and assuming that they so not clean the rooms every four hours, I was decidedly not going to stay there at all.I get to the front desk and complain to them that I will not stay in their hotel and that I wanted a refund as I had not even stayed there for 2 hours. I was promptly informed that according to the hotel policy, I had only 5 minutes after entering the room to decide whether I wanted to stay or not. When I told the attendant that we simply placed our bags in the room at midnight when we checked in, and went to get something to eat, she told me that the rule still applied. I told her to call the manager because I was not going to pay a thing (mind you they take full payment up front). She called the &quot;manager&quot; who was sleeping and decided not to come out, but told her that nothing could be done till the next day. I later found out that the manager ended up being the homeless looking fellow who was wandering the lobby in shorts and a torn T-Shirt when I was checking in. Needless to say we called a taxi immediately and went to the Holiday Inn Express just a few minutes away near to the Midway Airport. Spend the extra money and stay in a place where you wont get an STD from the sheets! Nothing is worth more while traveling than a clean hotel room and a respectable hotel in which to rest your head.NEVER EVER STAY HERE!!! If you respect yourself and your loved ones, you will not step foot into this cesspool!\\t\\n\",\n",

The whole &quot;hotel&quot; stank of cigarette smoke. My room had dried vomit on the floor. The night stand was covered in some sort of sticky goo. Only one outlet worked, that was the one the TV and the bedside lights were plugged into. Needless to say in order to charge my cellphone I went without TV, which was fine because there was no remote control. No closet to hang clothing just some hooks on the wall. The bathroom had all the amenities. The sink had no counter space the toilet had no cover. I didn't dare step foot in the sink for fear that I would be infected by some bacteria.We were supposed to get continental breakfast with our stay. That was a joke. We had to ask for it and the front desk guy went to the Jewel Osco and bought some cereal. ON our way down to &quot;breakfast&quot; we stumbled upon what one could only call vomit on the stairs.

Airport shuttle runs to the airport every two hours beginning at 4a and ending at either 8a or 10a (not too convenient but better than nothing). Exceedingly thin walls as we could hear the conversation next door. And one non-clean bathroom with very thin towels.Was in the lobby for a total of three minutes and encountered two oldest profession women. Pretty good looking but probably not the clientele you might encounter in a $70-80 per night &quot;inn.&quot; The good news is that there's a grocery store across the street (there were no stocked / working vending machines), a good hot dog place two doors down, nice enough staff, and it's really close to Midway Airport (five-seven minutes drive). So if you're looking for an experience, oldest profession women, or something really close to Midway, book it. Otherwise, you have been warned.\\t\\n\",\n",

Phones in rooms do not allow outgoing calls; must use phone in lobby. My room was not cleaned the first day and I was informed that it was my fault as I didn't expressly request my room be cleaned (isn't it usually the other way around--the default is to clean it?). This property should be rated NO STARS......\\t\\n\",\n",

If you are flying in, then they have a very frequent shuttle to pick you up from ORD. And if you are driving-in just for the weekend, the hotel is adjacent to the Blue Line Station to get into the city. Traffic can be maddening.They have an good fitness room in the basement and the pool area is adjacent with families. The only caution is that I would recommend any room ending in ##14, you will be away from the freeway and the room is set up as a 1 bedroom. Many room have the TV on a lazy Susan/dresser separating the sleeping area from the living area. Other thing, all bathrooms are modern walk-in showers--no tubs...\\t\\n\",\n",

The suite is spacious, comfortable and modernly decorated. Free internet is available at hotel lobby as well as executive lounge. It's about 20 minutes drive from Chicago downtown, 5 minutes from Rosemont convention center, 10 minutes from O'Hara airport. Hotel rate is very good for the weekend but expensive and hotly sought-after during Expo events.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nov 20 2009\\tWatch Your Wallet\\tThe architecture and food in Chicago are two thumbs up! The Renaissance Hotel - O'Hare has beautiful rooms but if you are a light sleeper you can hear planes taking off. The shuttle drivers are very helpful and friendly. Carlucci's Italian Restaurant nearby gets a 10 for food, service and atmosphere. Shoeless Joe Jackson's is a huge sports bar - huge portions, bar atmosphere.The downside is the commute to downtown. The trains are usually packed so we ended up standing for the 40 minute ride downtown. One of my friends had her wallet stolen on the Red Line. Very crowded and she forgot to take off her backpack purse.The wait to see the Sears Tower is 1 1/2 hours to get tickets and 1 1/2 hours to get to the sky deck so plan ahead. Water taxis are a great way to get full views of the downtown buildings. The Pier has something for everyone but the restrooms are far apart. The Frank Lloyd Wright tours are NOT available on the weekend.Howl at the Moon has great entertainment! Unfortunately, the server (who knew we were from out of town) or bartender added 6 beers to our bill and we didn't catch it until the next day. We contacted them but they basically said too bad. CHECK YOUR FOOD/BAR TABS BEFORE YOU PAY!!!Chicago was interesting but the thefts will keep me from returning.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Oct 19 2009 \\tExcellent Hotel Overpriced Parking\\tWe had two rooms at this hotel the weekend of the Chicago Marathon -- one room for my wife, myself, and our young children, and one room for my parents. The hotel is nice, the suites are roomy enough for families, and the huge bathrooms are fantastic. The location is good if you are planning on taking the train into town for everything you do (it's right next to Cumberland Station), as long as you don't mind a 30-minute train ride.I knew the parking was $20 a night, but I read some reviews online that said you could avoid it by parking in free lots around the hotel. But there aren't free lots around the hotel -- every lot has a sign saying that if you don't have a permit, you'll get towed. I didn't want to take the risk, so I parked in the hotel garage.Lovely hotel, but $20 per night parking is overpriced for the location. Also, no free wifi in the rooms. That was kind of surprising.\\t\\n\",\n",

Rooms are fabulous, extremely clean with comfortable beds, massive bathroom with really nice smellies and plenty of fluffy towels. We ate in the restaurant on 2 occasions and were more than happy with quality of the food and the service. Hot food (omlettes, pancakes etc) cooked to order so its always fresh. Also had sandwich from the bar, top class also. We would recommend this hotel to anyone. We choose it after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and were so glad we stayed there\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Oct 14 2009 \\tThe hotel was okay but not as amazing as I had hoped it would be\\tPros: The room was very clean and had great Aveda shampoo/soap (a plus since I had forgotten my own stuff). The beds were comfortable, and there were plenty of channels. The hotel itself was a great value, giving us an affordable place to stay during the Chicago Marathon. The room service was very prompt, and the food was pretty good. I particularly enjoyed their fries. They had a nice pool and hot-tub as well, with towels on the way there. The breakfast was pretty standard hotel breakfast, with a made-to-order omelette station (I didn't get to try this because they mixed up my omelette (no meat) with someone else's (lots of ham and bacon)). But it looked good...just keep an eye on your food. Cons: When we got into our room, one of the shades in the &quot;living room&quot; was broken, and the door deadlock would occasionally get stuck in the locked position. We never asked the staff to fix these problems so it may be unfair to complain about it. There was ALWAYS a wait at the front desk, no matter what time of day I went down there. I really felt like the hotel was understaffed, but maybe that was because it was a busy weekend. We asked for more towels in the morning and told them they could take their time as we didn't need them until the afternoon. We didn't realize that this would result in an 8 hour delay, after which we called for towels again. They were promptly sent up at that point. The concierge lounge was nice and quiet, but didn't have public computers or printers for use.Upon check-out, I was a little upset because when we asked the woman at the desk to hold our bags for the day (we could have asked for late checkout, but thought this would be more convenient for the hotel), she crammed my marathon poster into our bag, then wheeled it into a wall and bent it in half. I was shocked at the lack of care for personal belongings, so I'd recommend you not utilize this service.\\t\\n\",\n",

Room includes a very nice modern desk and ergonomic chair. The restaurant and bar offer good food, which is nice if youre stuck at this property which is about an hour from downtown Chicago on the subway. Driving at rush hour can take two hours to go fifteen miles to the downtown loop. Id normally stay at the Renaissance downtown, but decided to stay at this one because I had a meeting in the area.  The property has a decent fitness center with modern equipment. If youre a competitive or recreational swimmer youd hate the 20 yard lap pool because the water temperature is about 87 degrees. No one can swim laps in 87 degree water temperature. A better name would be a wading pool, which is great for kids.The hotel posted a note in the room that they were doing some minor exterior work on the building during the week day 9 - 5, which I didn't notice because I wasn't at the hotel during that time.\\t\\n\",\n",

It was perfect, from the fast, efficient check in, through to the big comfortable room, spotlessly clean, and the even bigger, very comfortable bed. The room was very quiet and the staff were very helpful with recommendations for local restaurants. Excellent value for money and so convenient for the airport. Highly recommended!

The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The service staff had pull-out linens to us within a few minutes of requesting them. The room cleaner even playfully propped my child's stuffed animals up in bed everyday. I was quite impressed with the overall experience. Rooms are nice and beds are very comfortable, but the pull-out beds are not.The hotel is very convenient to the &quot;L&quot; Cumberland station. We parked the car upon arrival and did not need to see it until we left (parking was $20/day for hotel guests in a covered garage). There is a short sidewalk from the hotel to the station, and the ride into the city is about 30 minutes. The trains run every 8 minutes, and I felt very comfortable doing this with my kids (although I'm also a very seasoned mass transit rider).We had a nice breakfast on our last day before leaving. It is quite pricey (thus why we only utilized it one day) but the food was very good and the staff quite accomodating. There is also a very nice indoor pool that the boys used before we left. Very clean pool, with a hot tub available for adults.Very nice experience, and I highly recommend this hotel as a less expensive alternative to pricey downtown hotels and parking!\\t\\n\",\n",

Same with needing a plastic bag for wet clothing... housekeeping brought 5 bags to us in a matter of minutes. The staff at the front desk were equally helpful and seemed to enjoy being of service. Top rankings in this dept.The hotel itself was pretty ho-hum. The lobby was nice but the rooms/hallways (4th floor) looked like they needed some help. The carpet was stained all over in the hallways. The room (a two double bed suite) is almost to small to be a suite. The chairs were pretty uncomfortable, and the hide-a-bed was awful... the mattress was worn so much my son wanted to sleep on the couch without unfolding the bed... and he was a good 4&quot; taller than the sitting area! Nice mini-fridge, no microwave, and a great coffee maker. The bath area was nice and large, tho, but the terrycloth shower curtain was kinda strange.the $20/night for parking in their garage isn't necessary either. The lot on the east side of the hotel worked fine for the weekend, although it may be a different story during the week (I think it's actually for the neighboring office buildings). Not a lot of choices around for dining, although the Dominick's super market on the other side of the freeway is very convenient.

I was there during a busy weekend when all hotels in the city were sold out or overpriced. I found this hotel online for a VERY reasonable rate (under $100), while 2 and 3 star hotels IN the city were charging near $200 to $400 a night. So, in that respect, this hotel is a deal. It's also reasonably convenient to the train - the closest hotel to the train stop (about a 2 minute walk a block aways).The rooms are desperately in need of a remodel. Honestly, they were not that clean (hair, dirt, crumbs, strange stains on floor, couch and towels). It wasn't super dirty, but it wasn't that clean, either. It was about the level of a Holiday Inn or therabouts.The front desk folks were nice. There's not much around within walking distance for food or anything. It's probably the nicest hotel near the airport and also fine for touring in to Chicago if you're trying to save money.\\t\\n\",\n",

Suite accomodations slept my wife &amp; I in the king bed, and our two boys (8 &amp; 10) on the sofa sleeper. Front desk informs you that you can call Housekeeping to make up the sofa sleeper, which they did within a few minutes notice.Nice large bathroom had large walk-in shower, but a very high countertop means you have to wheel the desk chair in so the kids can reach the sink to brush teeth. Hard surfaces in the bathroom also meant that sounds echoed, so even though the bath can be closed off from the bedroom and sitting areas, it can be loud when you're trying to get the kids asleep for an early wakeup.Limited services available after 5pm-- Starbucks was closed. We went out to dinner, then early to bed for a 2am wakeup (eek!). Airport shuttle runs on the half-hours, all night long if you need it.Indoor parking can't be beat but spaces are tight and people park however they darn well please. The only glitch was my parking ticket didn't work in the exit gate upon returning from our trip, after being authorized for the week of parking before we left. Fortunately no one was behind me at the automated gate, as I had to back up and re-park, then go back to the front desk and wait behind other customers while my family was waiting anxiously in the lobby. The front desk eventually gave me a new ticket which allowed me to exit the garage successfully!We'll definitely return for future Park &amp; Fly's from ORD. Even if you're not flying out, check those rates because normal hotel parking is $20 per day and it might be cheaper than what you're quoted elsewhere for this property.\\t\\n\",\n",

The shuttle service was offered 24 hours and was very prompt. Front desk service was exceptionally helpful with airport information.The room was a spotless and spacious two-room suite. The living room area had a large tv, desk, chair and sizeable sofa. Beautifully decorated. The bedroom also had a tv. The bed was quite comfortable and the sheets were high quality. The bathroom amenities were upscale and aromatic and included shampoo, conditioner, facial and body soap as well as lotion. A hairdryer and magnifying mirror were also in the bathroom. The shower was amazing- huge, glass walled with various water pressure settings. The towels were fluffy and soft. Also, for an airport hotel it was surprisingly quiet. Maybe it was the location of my room, but I was hardly disturbed by noise even tho I could see planes coming and going. The only possible negative was a lack of dining options in a walkable distance. The room service and on-site pub menus were limited and a bit pricier than expected. I would stay at this hotel again when flying in and out of O'Hare. While there is an el stop nearby, I would think it too far for a stay involving downtown activities, but it was a nice hotel all around.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Jun 22 2009 \\tVery good choice if you want to be close to O'Hare\\tI booked a weekend package here for my wife, adult daughter and myself through Travelocity. We were able to stay in one room because a sleeper sofa was available for my daughter and separate bedroom for my wife and I -( a definite advantage when Dad is picking up the tab for the weekend). Extra towels and bedding for the sofa were delivered promptly after a call to the front desk, and we found the service to be very good overall.We were visiting my son and his wife and didn't dine or drink here. There are no restaurants or convenience stores that we saw within walking distance.I won't repeat others' comments about the nice rooms and proximity to the blue line. We prefer to be closer to downtown, but for the money and accommodations, this property is hard to beat.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 19 2009 \\tEasy Park and Fly\\tWe stayed here the night before an 8AM from O'Hare. The highway access is super easy and the shuttle got us to O'Hare quickly. Our room was on the tenth floor facing the highway so we had a little noise but nothing too bad. We got in late so we didn't visit the restaurant or bar but they looked decent enough. You're just steps from the Cumberland stop on the Blue Line so there are lots more options easily available. The room was a full suite, which I hadn't expected, so there was plenty of room to move around. I would consider this as a base for a long term visit to the city, at least when the Blue Line weekend work is done. Not a luxury hotel but very comfortable.We booked a ridiculously cheap rate through Park Sleep Fly, which included up to 2 weeks of covered parking and the total was less than if we'd used the O'Hare remote lot. We'd definitely stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 16 2009 \\tGreat Hotel Great Price\\tA modern and stylish hotel located close to O'Hare. Easy access to and from aiport via hotel shuttle (runs every 30 min) - but you need to call if you want to be picked up from T5 International terminal. Rooms are large and sunny with light wood finishes. Suites consist of a living room with sofa, chair and an office area. TV is a large LCD affair with AV inputs that you can hook your laptop up to. The Bedrooms are also large and well equipped with a second tv (CRT only) bedding is high quality and the bed is comfortable. The suite has a large bathroom with huge walk in shower. In the lobby is a stylish sitting area and a small rather dark bar and a good restaurant. Key to the visit is the proximity of the Blue line taking you directly downtown in about 20 minutes. This makes this hotel an attractive proposition for leisure visitors. I had a great stay and at only $95 a night booked from the Marriott website it is a bargain - easily 100-200 cheaper than staying downtown\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'May 16 2009 \\tThey Ripped me off with unauthorized charges on my credit card\\tThe hotel is nice enough. But beware, they will hit your credit card with charges you will know little to nothing about until you get your credit card bill.We were at a function downtown and pre-paid for a room at this hotel. The hotel is nice as was the room. However, if you drive there and expect to park your car there please think twice.When we arrived it was raining, the valet service had cars parked in every conceivable spot, include more than a dozen cars with only two wheels still on the pavement and the rest of the car up over the curb. As a result, we were greated near the street by the value and handed our claim ticket. We walked into the front entrance and directly to the front desk to check in.No where did we see a sign advising of the parking charge for guests that park there. There is a sign, but it is way over on the side of the building next to the garage exit - not someplace we came anywhere close to. We were not informed by any staff of any charges for parking. I know some hotels do charge their guests for parking, but others do not.We stayed the night and when we left I checked out at the front desk and they said everything was taken care of. So I dropped off the room keys and went to get our car. We were not offered nor given a receipt. I assumed there was no need since there was no reason to have additional charges other than what I already paid for when I booked the room.Handing the car claim ticket to the valet service we then waited for the car to be brought out. And waited, and waited - we waited over 30 minutes. Again the drive was completely packed with parked cars they had yet to relocate into the parking garage. So when our car finally came out they had only one place they could put it and that was out near the street again - at least this time it was not raining.Having to check my credit card account for other reasons today I noticed several charges from the hotel. One was 25.01, and the other was 19.99. So I called, they had no idea what those charges were for - supposedly my card was to be charged $45 for parking and $5.99 for a bottle of water from the mini-bar that we never even opened.Parking in downtown Chicago on a weekend for any overnight rarely costs more than $25 at any parking garage. Thus this charge, which they neither got my consent for nor did they inform me of it at any time while at the hotel, is very excessive.After speaking with a manager at the hotel they agreed to remove the mini-bar charge, but refused to remove the parking charge.I have a great deal of problem with any business that takes free license to charge your credit cards without first informing you of those charges and obtaining your consent for those charges. Because they seem to be able to do this and have no problem doing it I would strongly advise that you avoid this hotel.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"May 5 2009 \\tSuperior Location to Airport Nice Rooms\\tWe stayed two nights in this hotel, just a short distance from Chicago's O'Hare airport. The hotel offers a free shuttle service to and from the airport that runs about every 20 minutes, you can take the CTA blue line, which is just a 5-minute walk from the front door of the hotel, or I'm sure you can call a cab too (we didn't use a cab at all).The rooms of the hotel are nice, if a bit modern. The noise of the airport isn't bad, though there is an airplane headed overhead from time to time that you can hear. For being so close to one of the world's busiest airports, it's surprisingly quiet. Our room had no bathtub in it, which wasn't a big deal, but if for some reason you like a tub, this might be an issue for you. Check to see if they have one.While the hotel offers a unique 'dive in' movie every Friday and Saturday night at their indoor pool, where you can pull up a float or a lounge chair and watch a family movie by the pool, in practice it doesn't work very well. First, you can't listen to it because, well, kids are loud and pool enclosures tend to echo. Second, you can't see it very well because pools need a certain amount of lighting and the hotel didn't choose to use a very powerful projector. So if you want to choose this place solely for this purpose, it might not be the best choice.As you might surmise, the hotel isn't really family-friendly. This isn't to say it's a bad hotel, as it's not. It appears to be quite new, and everything is rather nice. But it is nestled among several office buildings, meaning there are really no choices for anything to do outside 'working hours', and very few things to do even inside those hours. The buildings themselves are alongside a rather large freeway. A somewhat residential area is available across the freeway, and there is a footpath across the freeway - but it's a bit of a hike.Because of that, the lack of a tub, and the design of the hotel's eating facilities, it is somewhat surprising that they even have a family night such as this one, as the two don't really fit together. But for us, the hotel served the purpose well, and we could easily catch the train into town when we needed to do so. Speaking of which, the best deal we found was to get a Visitor Pass - $5 for 24 hours of unlimited riding of trains and buses, available at a number of locations, including the airport.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 21 2009 \\tNO CONCIERGE AVAILABLE!\\tI really wanted to like this hotel but the fact that they didn't have a concierge available (especially first time in Chicago) Concierge leaves at 10:30am. and you have to be an Elite member to get access to the concierge lounge.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 6 2009 \\tGreat stay and fly hotel!\\tThis hotel is located 5 minutes from O'Hare. The parking for our car was a covered structure, which was better than other hotels. They have 24 hour service to the airport. The hotel suite was roomy. It was clean. The bed was comfortable. The staff was VERY courteous. The van driver was quite helpful, particularly since my husband is handicapped.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Feb 26 2009 \\tDecent Room nice hotel overall but does not appear to have Marriott Revive Bedding\\tThis hotel is fairly nice. The front desk staff was very friendly and the room was very clean. My only complaint was the bedding. Most Marriott hotels have upgraded to the Marriott Revive bedding, but this hotel does not appear to have done so. The bed was very firm and not as comfortable as I'm accustomed to at most Marriott/Renaissance hotels. It also does not yet have flat screen/hdtv. While this hotel was nice, I gave it an average rating in comparison to most other Marriotts.\\t\\n\",\n",

Clean and spacious. It was well worth the money. We were able to use the pool and it was warm and clean. Staff was very helpful and the shuttle was quick and easy to the airport. No problems at all. We will stay here again.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Feb 3 2009 \\tLove this hotel!\\tWe usually always stay at this hotel when in the O'Hare area. The quality you expect from a Renaissance property is what you get: Great! The location is good...not too close but not too far from the airport, and they DO provide an airport shuttle every 30 minutes. There are places to eat and drink on the other side of the highway in Rosemont (about a 2 minute drive). Parking is in a covered garage (extra charge depending on your room rate) which is nice in both summer and winter.The hotel is a very nice-looking hotel. The decor is well put-together and it is clean and new. Every room is a suite with plenty of room and a pull-out sofa. One of my favorite parts of this hotel is the bathrooms; no bathtub, but the shower is amazing and beautiful. The bed is soft and fitted with nice linens and plenty of pillows. The front desk is usually extremely helpful.There is a Starbucks downstairs near the lobby and the hotel bar/lounge is a nice place to have a few drinks if you have no mode of transportation.This property also offers a very reasonable park, sleep and fly deal.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 21 2009 \\tModern Clean next to transit\\tAsolutely perfect. Very modern and clean hotel. Would stay there again next time I go to Chicago. You are 5 minutes away from O'hare airport and 25 mins from downtown. You can walk to the rapid transit line (CTA Cumberland).\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 14 2009 \\tGreat Hotel\\tWe try and stay here every time we fly out of O'hare. Great service, rooms, bar, food and shuttle. The rooms are large and very nice. They have covered parking and the shuttle is easy to find when leaving O 'Hare.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jan 8 2009\\tShort but pleasant stay\\tWe spent one night at the Renaissance OHare and found good value. Especially if you need a park, sleep and fly package for an early morning flight from OHare. Note, we left our vehicle for a week in the parking ramp and did not have any theft issues as noted in a different review. However we parked in the middle of the rows and did not leave anything of value in the vehicle. We checked in at 10 pm. The staff was energetic and courteous for that hour of the day. Our room was a suite and much more than we needed for our 7 hour stay with a fridge, sofa, TV and working area in the business side and our bed, bath and a TV in the bedroom area. The room was clean and fairly modern. The bed was only average, but very spacious.We ate in the hotel bar. At 1015 pm, t he menu was limited, but the food was okay. The service was very good. We also noticed a deli and snack area near the front desk with prepared sandwiches, salads, sodas and snacks which all looked pretty good.Check our was fast at 445 am and the shuttle took us right to the terminal. They also validated our parking at that time so it was not necessary to do that on the way back. We did wait a bit on the return for pick up, but on the whole the van service was adequate.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Dec 25 2008 \\tExcellent Stay at Renaissance\\tWe stayed at the Renaissance Chicago O'Hare Suites using a sleep and fly package. Check-in went smoothly with a friendly front desk staff. The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable, with a bedroom area and attached living room area with separate flat-screen TV's. The bath was very modern with a large glassed-in shower. There were nice ammenities and products in the bath. We visited the lounge area for cocktails in the evening and service was great and the quality of drinks was very good. The lobby was impressive and their Christmas decorations were beautiful.We used the shuttle service to the airport which was efficient and prompt. Upon our return, they were equally efficient. We appreciated the covered parking area and did not experience any problems there. Although our stay was brief, we would definitely go back and also would recommend it to anyone.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 3 2008 \\tGood for pre flight night\\tStayed at the hotel one night before flying out of O'Hare on vacation. Very nice hotel but hard to find since it is set inside off of the main streets.Rooms were very nice and large with good amenities. Ate at the hotel and food and service were very good. Manager immediately waited on us and spoke with us about how large the portions were. We were going to order too much food based on the huge size of portions, so he was very friendly and assisted us. Waitress was very helpful also.I thought this hotel was very good value and location was good for flying out of O'Hare. Free shuttle service was good, departing every 30 minutes on the hour and 1/2 hour.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dec 1 2008 \\tLoved this place!!\\tWow, talk about really nice hotel rooms, we loved just about everything. The color scheme and layout were extremely well thought out, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was very spacious (we forgot to ask for a room with a tub, so we only had a shower but it was a very large walk in shower). The flat screen TV swiveled so you could watch TV from the sofa or while in bed. We found the hotel to be very quiet, we did not hear any plane noise. The sheets need a bit of upgrading as they were not the softest. The room was quite warm, we ended up opening a window for a while to get the room cooled down. The staff was friendly and the 24 hours convenience store with salads, milk, soda, and other items was exactly that, convenient and not overly expensive. It's right by the front desk so you just grab what you want and pay at the front desk. The lobby is very attractive, lots of wood and very warm looking. The indoor pool was nice and clean. The hotel was showing a movie for families on Sat. night . You could swim and watch Finding Nemo. The hot tub was also nice and clean but very very hot, I would suggest they lower the temp a bit, everyone that went in was complaining about how hot it was. The pool water was very comfortable. We paid $20/day to park but were staying using Marriott points so I did not mind. Others paying full price, probably will mind. I don't think they should charge for parking. There was no bell staff at the entrance to offer to help with luggage etc. All in all we enjoyed our one night stay and definitely would consider returning for the right price.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nov 30 2008 \\tCAUTION Park and Fly\\tMy partner and I purchased a park and fly package through the hotel for the covered parking. The vehicle was parked close to the elevator on the 2nd floor in a main area of the garage. The vehicle was vandelized and GPS Unit stolen from Console (security coded) and Sirius Radio stolen. Broken passenger windshield, broken console and damaged door. The hotel and hotel parking is behind an office building and not well traveled in the evening. The parking gate was left open at least one of the evenings. The manager has indicated they have no responsbility for the parking structure. There is no warning posted to hotel guest your parking at your own risk. The manager has indicated they have had this issue before. I suggested she advise the General Manager to put up cameras or have the employees walk through the parking lot once in a while. A Police Report was filed with the Chicago Police Department. The 1st room we had was a hard mattress. The room on the return trip was a softer matress. I would not stay at this hotel again for a park and fly unless the parking lot was more secure.\\t\\n',\n",

       " \"Oct 2 2008 \\tEnjoyed our stay.\\tMy friend and I stayed at the Renaissance Sept 12th-15th. I loved the room with separate bedroom and huge bathroom. We wanted a tub and were accomodated. Some notables:I agree with another reviewer that the beds were really firm. We had a room w/two double beds and both were pretty hard. Aside from that, very clean &amp; soft linens. Flat panel tv in the &quot;living room&quot;, that was nice. The big desk /mini fridge was great, too.You have to pay $10/day for in-room internet, although there is free wifi in the lobby.The breakfast buffet at Fresh is really good. For $12, you get all you can eat: fresh fruit, oatmeal, made-to-order omelettes/pancakes/french toast, bagels, muffins, bacon, sausage...endless. We really enjoyed this and ate there the mornings that we had time. The only odd thing that happened was that the entire hotel lost power our last night there. This was after two days of horrible rain. We managed to get warm showers before leaving, which was a pleasant surprise. The hotel staff was very nice about the power-outage and apologized for the inconvenience. Even with the power outage, our bill was still shoved under our room door for easy check-out. We obviously couldn't use the video check-out as there was no power, but checking out took no more than two minutes at the front desk.The hotel did a great job of accomodating our needs, i.e. bringing us a bottle opener and robes when requested.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 16 2008 \\tGreat place when flying out of Ohare\\tWe stayed here with the park-and-fly rate booked through a third party Web site and loved the experience. The only part I did not like was driving through Chicago to get there. Once there, the parking is INDOORS. The area felt safe. The shuttle was 24 hours and perfect in both taking us and picking us up at the airport. PLUS the hotel is right beside the EL train if you want/need to go other places and don't want to drive. The service was exceptional in all areas we used. The rooms were way cool and suites. No free breakfast? True but overall a good deal for the price. If you don't believe me, price the parking for your trip as if you'd park at the airport, then price the room at this hotel with the park-and-fly rate. You'll get the idea quick.\\t\\n\",\n",

(Not a fan of Hard beds)Excellent Excersize room, with OK pool in the basement.Excellent Bar, Good Restaruant (Fresh?), and Starbucks in the lobby. Parking is expensive, but close and safe.I have stayed here multiple times, and it's my son's favorite hotel.Soundproofing is quite impressive considering it's proximity to O'Hare.We'll most likely be back here.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 20 2008 \\tSolid choice at O'Hare\\tI've stayed in several of the hotels at O'Hare, and this is one of the best (even better, if often has very reasonable rates). --Efficient check-in.--Great staff overall--everyone I interacted with, from the shuttle driver to housekeeping, was polite and helpful.--Huge, big rooms. The suites have a large desk that allowed me to spread out and get a lot of work done. The bathrooms are also very large.--Great bedding! I had a great night's sleep. The rooms also have room-darkening shades, which was a lot better than typical hotel curtains that gap open and let in light.--Timely, tasty room service.--I liked that they sold buy-to-go meals in the lobby. I grabbed one on my way to the airport.--Decent fitness center. Would like it better if it wasn't in the basement, but it had good cardio and weight equipment, free water, etc.A couple of the surfaces in the room were showing some signs of age (some chipped wood, some worn fabric on a chair) but not enough to be a problem.Overall, an excellent stay -- a very solid choice if you have to overnight at O'Hare. It is a little farther from the airport than some of the other hotels, but the shuttle ride is still only about 15 minutes, and it's right next to the train if you want to ride it downtown.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 15 2008 \\tFinally a wonderful airport hotel!\\tAfter staying in a few other hotels by the airport, my expectations were not that high. However, I have finally found my hotel of choice when attending meetings by O'Hare. The room was very welcoming with its bright colors. And despite the planes taking off and landing, the sound -proofing was excellent. The room was spacious with comfortable and yet very functional furniture. The bathroom is definitely large and the walk-in shower wonderful. The bed provided a very restful night of sleep. Service throughout the entire stay was superb and the staff always friendly and accommodating. Having Starbucks downstairs and a tiny convenience store was a bonus. Parking was reasonable and it was great to be able to self-park without having to go so far. Great hotel for business travelers, as once you are in your room - it is very quiet.\\t\\n\",\n",

I stayed here to do work travel and a special coupon.This hotel was &quot;nice&quot; but with small rooms and extra $$ for everything. Internet was $10 per day; using a computer cost $$ per MINUTE and so did printing. There was no &quot;free&quot; breakfast of any kind, just overpriced resturants. The pool and workout room were nice and well equipped. I wouldn't stay here again on my own but for those that like &quot;full service&quot; it's at least a pretty hotel and the staff was more than accomodating. They even had a cell phone charger service, where if you left your charger at home, they go through the ones unclaimed by previous guests, try to find a match and charge your phone/laptop; that was pretty cool.\\t\\n\",\n",

Extra days cost $20, though. This is a big hotel. Lots of airline crew were there when we checked out. Everything was very clean and very nice--probably the nicest room I have ever stayed in. The suites rooms are modern, nicely decorated, and stylish. The bathroom includes a huge shower enclosed in glass. No bathtub. The room is nicely equipped, with 2 LCD TV's, a fridge, safe, hair dryer, etc. There was even a copy of Newsweek in the room and a glass bottle of water. There is no kitchen, however. A few quibbles--I prefer disposable cups to glass. The hotel avoids normal names for things, so it's 'hair wash' instead of 'shampoo', and something cute instead of 'do not disturb'. The clock radio is the most complicated I have ever seen. A card placed on it helpfully suggests arranging for a wake-up call instead. No breakfast is included and anything you buy will be expensive. As a high end hotel, they have a trademark scent blasting in the lobby. Anyone with issues to fragrances would be doomed. I actually found the lobby design a bit lacking and sterile, even though there are lots of comfortable chairs. Airport shuttles are frequent, large and nice. It takes about 20 minutes to get to and from the airport.\\t\\n\",\n",

I much prefer to stay in the city, especially in a place like Chicago, but since I had a business meeting in a building that was literally a 5 minute walk away it made sense to stay close by. (This comes in handy too with the unpredictable Chicago winter weather!) I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel. First off, it's pretty new so everything is very clean and the design is modern. The rooms include a living room with desk and sitting area, and a separate bedroom. The bathrooms are large - I'm female, I always judge a hotel by its bathroom - and the shower was huge. Plus they have a Starbucks in the hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",

For a family with teenage daughters, all trying to get ready before our early flight, we could not have asked for more.We have stayed at other ParknFly hotels near O'Hare, so we know what we are talking about here.The pool was awesome, and the workout room has a window into the pool. So I could keep an eye on both of my girls, one swam and the other worked out.The &quot;L&quot; is right across the street for easy access to Chicago.We will definetly use this hotel again!\\t\\n\",\n",

My airline gave me a voucher for discounted hotels near the airport, and this hotel had the best price- $79 plus tax and fees for a Sunday night. I was able to catch the free shuttle to the hotel. I was really suprised by the warm colors and modern design in both the lobby and room! This hotel is a chain of the Marriott Hotels, so I expected the same sort of cookie cutter look I had previously seen with Marriott. I booked a non smoking suite with a king size bed. The room was very warmly decorated with deep reds and gold. The shower was fantastic with the large open glass shower stall. I have to say, that I was really wishing that there was a nice tub to bathe in after such a stressful day. The bedroom offered a bed with down comforter, closet, tv, and cd alarm clock. In the sitting room, there was a really comfortable couch, foot stools, large desk and office station, a tv and coffee/tea station. My room also offered a refrigerator (not a minibar) for use. I really wish that I could have stayed here for much longer and explored. The service was very fast and quite friendly. There is a starbucks located in the hotel as well as Fresh restaurant and R bar. There was also food available by the check in desk while the restaurant was closed, but it was rather expensive ($9 for a sandwhich). I would most definitely stay here again.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jun 10 2008 \\tConveniently Located and Nice Hotel\\tMy self and 3 colleagues were on a business trip to Chicago. We landed at OHare grabbed a rental car and drove to the hotel. The hotel is a bear to get to during rush hour as you have to go through a toll plaza and then jump 6 lanes of traffic to the right to get off in time. Arrival was fine check in was polite and smooth. I do grumble about $20/day to park in an attached garage. They give you a paper receipt that the hotel validates then as you come and go you have to feed the ticket into the slot at the non-attended gate, you still get charged $20 per night the validation just allows you to come and go... no big deal just an aggravation. Hotel lobby is nice, but loud - there is free wireless internet in the lobby only.. otherwise it's about $10/ night in the room. There is a Starbucks on site and a hotel restaurant and bar I didn't use. The rooms are suites - spacious and clean comfortable bedding. There is a glass enclosed shower stall that was nice, but the drain was VERY slow moving and by the end of the shower I had a nice little lake built up. The hotel has a nice gym in the lower level, steppers, treadmills, ellipticals, free weight dumb bells up to 50lbs and some cable machines - a lot more than most hotels offer!!! We got a rate of $188/ night.All in all not a bad hotel and very convenient to anywhere in Chicago. You are in the flight path to OHare but even on the 10th floor I could not hear the planes as they landed I would probably stay here mostly because it is convenient.\\t\\n\",\n",

The restaurant waiter was so nice, best service ........sorry I forgot to get your name or else I would have posted it here. ....he was the best. ........The ladies in the reception were extra nice too.....my kids kept switching the rooms back &amp; forth two times and they were very glad to offer the room of our choice. .........Thank you Renaissance, will definitely stay there again.........:)\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 22 2008 \\tGreat hotel at O'Hare\\tI normally don't stay at airport hotels, but this was an exception and well worth it. The Renaissance O'Hare is a modern suite-type hotel with a nice sitting area, separate bedroom, and a huge bathroom. While it is only minutes to the airport with a free shuttle, it is also easy to get downtown Chicago. There is a train station about 500 feet from the hotel that you could get to by foot. Although it takes a little less than an hour to get downtown, it is very inexpensive. Overall, this was a very nice hotel at a great value.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Apr 1 2008 \\tMixed Review\\tThis would have been a great location for a three star hotel, the only problem is that this is a four star.Overall this propoerty worked well for us. It has a wonderful location, just steps away from the subway, blue line, cumberland station.The room was clean and in order. It had everything we needed, and the bed is very comfortable. If you can get a deal on your rate this is a good choice, but if you want the service of a four star you may want to consider some place else. The room advertised bathrobes, we had to ask for them. Our rate included breakfast, but it was &quot;accidentally&quot; added to our room one morning. The keys are elecrtonic cards like every where else, but ours stopped working several times. These are all small details, but shouldn't happen at this class of property. Like I said, if you get a good rate, this place will do just fine.The food at the restaurant was good, and reasonably priced. There were towels, water and fruit available at the pool. If you exit the subway skywalk in the opposite direction, you'll find a grocery store about two hundreed yards down the sidewalk.We paid $199 for a week night, I wouldn't pay that for this place again. But we paid $115 for a weekend night, which included breakfast, I would do that again. If you want location, A+. If you want service, B+. If you want the small details of a higher class property, B-.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Apr 1 2008\\tThe PERFECT \"Park and Fly\"\\tMy brother and I stayed at this hotel prior to flying out to Miami for a brief vacation. The &quot;Park and Fly&quot; rate was just excellent with 10 days of covered parking included in the price.The hotel is new and modern and the room are excellently appointed. The beds are unbelievably comfortable with great pillows. The room included a comfortable sitting area separate to the sleeping area. The bathroom, like the rest of the room, was spacious and well equiped. The bathroom only has a shower however it was huge. The only minor dissapointment was that it was equiped only with a fairly basic shower and it could easily have accommodated a powerful multi head shower which would have been in keeping with the very modernistic look of the frameless shower stall. This being said, if the most one could complain about is the shower, then we were pretty lucky.I would highly recommend this hotel and will not go anywhere else when flying out of O\\'Hare again. That being said, actually, I would stay here above anywhere else even when visiting the city. Full marks.\\t\\n',\n",
       " \"Mar 26 2008 \\tPerfect Overnighter\\tWe picked this hotel to stay at overnight before we left Ohare for Puerto Rico. We drove from Milwaukee and had an early flight the next day and we chose the park, sleep, fly option where we stayed one night and got to park at the hotel for 10 days. The price was all inclusive and we got a free shuttle ride to and from the hotel and airport. The rooms were extremely spacious. All of them had a separate bedroom, bathroom, and separate living area with mini-fridge and microwave. We didn't really get to take advantage of much since we had no idea how nice this place was and was just using it for the cheap room/car storage. We paid $100 for the one night and 10 days car parking on Jan 2nd. We did check out the large pool area and fitness center. They had free apples and bottles of water out near the fitness center. If I would have known it was such a nice place, we would have driven down earlier in the day and started our vacation a day early! Beds are comfy and bathroom was really nice. Place was spotless and decorated very modern. Would recommend this place to anyone!\\t\\n\",\n",

The last time we stayed it was a bit noisy....on the highway/metro side...so make sure you request a room on the opposite side.....we did and it was quiet and comfy.

       " \"Feb 7 2008\\tNice airport hotel\\tAfter being stranded at O'Hare by United Airlines, I needed a place to sleep for the night at my own expense. United gave me a slip of paper to call a &quot;distressed passenger service,&quot; and they offered me the Renaissance for $79. Renaissance hotels are usually nice, so it seemed like a good bet.Indeed it was. Excellent shuttle service to the airport every 20 minutes, and then about a 10 minute ride. Very fast and friendly check-in, and the hotel looks sharp. Annoying double beds instead of queens, but you do also get a fold out coach if you're travelling with kids. The beds were super comfortable, and with all rooms suites, there's plenty of space. Definitely in the top 10% of all airport hotels I've stayed in.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Jan 29 2008 \\tWhat a Find!\\tThis is one of the nicest hotels near O'Hare...And I've stayed at most of them! United Airlines put me up here for a night after a recent cancellation...They usually get me the Hilton, but they were booked. I have very little bad to say about this place! First of all, the room was quite spacious--a little larger than most all-suite properties. The decor was very new and fresh. The parlor room had a flat-panel TV while the bedroom had a standard tube TV. The bathroom was very large and marblesque. I joked with my wife about the shower--I came out and said, &quot;Whew, that was close--I almost got lost in there!&quot; The shower was that big. A few minor gripes with the room: the blinds--they were very tough to close. Also, while the bed was super-comfy, the pillows were pretty weak. But my biggest gripe was the bed was a queen--not sure if they have Kings or not...We sleep on a king at home, so to us it seemed cramped. This was a club-level room--I have low-level elite status with Marriott, so not sure if the standard rooms are any different. The restauant was amazing! It was a Saturday night shortly before closing--only people in there. Service was great, but the food...I had their signature pasta dish, which was to die for. Next time United strands me at O'Hare, I'll request this hotel over the Hilton, even though it's about 10 minutes further from ORD.\\t\\n\",\n",

This was a beautiful, clean, quiet hoteland the parking was indeed covered and attached to the hotel. I felt very safe leaving my car there. I ordered room service because I was alone, and it was served on real china and very promptly. I would recommend this hotel, especially if you are flying out of O'Hare and need to park your car. The shuttle was very convenient.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Dec 23 2007\\tExcellent airport hotel\\tI usually stay downtown when visiting Chicago but this time downtown rates were so high that I tried this airport hotel which offered a suite at a quarter of the price. The location is offsite from the airport but the complementary shuttles seem to run quite frequently. The hotel is also a short walking distance to a cta blue line stop which will get you downtown in about 45-50 minutes. Other than that there is nothing of interest walking distance from the hotel.The suite was very satisfactory - of average size but comfortable and in very good condition - great value for the money. The whole property feels very fresh. Room service was a little disappointing in quality, there's also a starbucks in the lobby and a small fridge in the suite. The highway and cta blue line tracks are just next to the hotel so there's a moderate amount of noise - you may therefore want to request a room on the quieter side of the hotel.Riding the cta blue line to downtown was slow but very economical. At 11pm, the trains were still quite full and there were other guests from this hotel and the Marriott on the other side of the highway riding the same train.Overall highly recommended for park and fly, early flights out of O'Hare, quick stopovers in Chicago, or as a budget alternative when downtown hotels are overpriced.Property: 4/5 - Service: 5/5 - Cleanliness: 5/5 - Location: 3/5Room: 5/5 - Amenities: 4/5 - Views: 3/5Value: 5/5 (paid $109+tax/night weekend stay)OVERALL: 4.5/5\\t\\n\",\n",

It's a great option since you can leave your car there for up to 10 days in covered parking. The suite was very clean, well appointed, and with super comfortable beds (which is why I prefer Marriott). The staff was very attentive and epitomized customer service. Complimentary shuttle to and from Ohare (about 5 minute drive). I'll definitely use the park and fly option at this hotel from this point on! Great place to stay!!\\t\\n\",\n",

       " \"Oct 29 2007 \\tGREAT Family Getaway\\tOur family of 3 spent a 3-day weekend in Chicago, driving north from St. Louis. Our selection of this hotel was based primarily on their very attractive weekend pricing, their &quot;suite&quot; arrangement, and of course the indoor pool! The stay was excellent. Very easy to enjoy the hotel and its ammenities. As other reviewers have noted, there is a 30-40 min ride into town on the blue line. The stop is adjacent to the hotel which makes it very convenient. Since this was a very leisurely trip for us, the ride to/from downtown Chicago wasn't a problem. We did purchase the 2-day visitor passes for $9 which worked well. (Note: our room was on the end closest to the train tracks/freeway and I heard the train all through the night. It didn't keep me awake, but I woke up several times each night).The room is well equipped, but not very large. We did use the sleeper sofa in the &quot;living room&quot; and when out, the bed took up about all of the floor space. The rooms have a coffee service area which is nice (to hold you over until you make it down to Starbuck's in the lobby!). The fridge is also handy. Most notable about our room was the &quot;olympic size&quot; shower! It was so huge it seemed you could run laps within it...My husband used the fitness room and said it was excellent.We did not use the restaurant in the hotel as prices seemed too high. We ate downtown for most meals with the exception of one evening when we went to Bennigan's across the street from the hotel.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Oct 2 2007 \\tOverall a good deal!\\tI stayed in this hotel during the last weekend of September. It is really close to Ohare airport. So that is a big positive. Overall, the hotel itself is very clean and looks to be in excellent condition. There is a Starbucks in the lobby area. The rooms and bathrooms were very nice (suite setup). The 24 hour gym is very well kept and easily accessible. Parking is steep at $20 a night. It is a garage that is right next to the hotel but it seems like a bit of a scam to be that expensive. I arrived on a Friday night and the receptionist at the front counter that I checked in with was very rude and seemed like she was flustered or perhaps working too many hours. This was my first encounter at the hotel and this certainly did not paint a good picture in my mind. However, after speaking with the hotel manager that was on for the night, I was very satisfied. The manager apologized for that employee's behavior and waived the parking fees for the weekend. I think that the specific girl at the front counter was an employee that was either having a bad day or just had a bad attitude in general. Either way, every other employee that I encountered was extremely nice and helpful.I did not use room service or the in house restaurant /bar...so I'm unable to comment about that. I unfortunately had the bad experience with the receptionist but I think that was truly an isolated incident. Parking rates are a bit steep considering the fact that this is not anywhere near downtown. In summary, the hotel itself is very nice...probably rate it around 3.5 out of 5.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 30 2007 \\tGreat Choice-- could change a few things...\\tWe stayed at the Renaissance O'Hare Suites for 2 nights. Our family of 4 (parents and 2 teens) enjoy the extra room offerred by &quot;suite&quot;hotels. The suite is one room, w/ 2 queens and a sofa bed. A low set of drawers w/ a tv on top is the divider between the two areas. (Other suite hotels we have stayed in have offerred 2 separate areas, w/ 2 tv's). The hotel still feels fresh and new and was very clean. The bathroom was large, but the vanity area is inside the bathroom (1 sink) across from an over-sized glass shower (no privacy at all). I expect that most families that stay in one room are like ours, in that it helps to be able to have 2 people getting ready at the same time at a separate vanity and sink area, or at least to having a shower curtain!! Having a room that sleeps 5 with a glass shower was really silly, in my opinion. The sofabed linens were not in the room, but blankets were quickly delivered w/ one call. They have a business area on the 2nd floor where I printed our boarding passes, and that was very helpful. The restaurants were very expensive and we were very tired so we ordered take-out from Bennigans (across the parking lot) and walked over and brought it back. Staff was helpful with directions and was very courteous. We used the airport shuttle at 5am, and appreciated this amenity.The location is about one block from Blue Line and that was incredibly convenient. We would choose this hotel again if we needed an airport location.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sep 28 2007\\tGood hotel for business\\tI stayed here and attended a training session held for work at this hotel. The rooms were great - very large and with good amenities for working (separate desk and chair, etc.). The front desk staff were a bit indifferent. Seemed very interested in talking with each other rather than paying attention to the task at hand.\\t\\n',\n",

We were able to get our rooms right next door to each other and were even upgraded to executive suites. The rooms are clean and comfortable and quite spacious! It is conveniently located next to the blue line for easy transportation back to center city. The front desk was SO helpful with directions especially for all of us who weren't familiar with the Chicago area.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Sep 4 2007 \\tThey don't quite get it yet at the Renaissance\\tWith all the Hawkeye &amp; Cub fans in town for Labor Day games, rooms in the Loop were hard to find for the weekend of our daughters college move-in. So we went out to Rosement, just a few minutes up I90 from downtown. My hubby checked in Friday, while I arrived on Saturday at 4Pm. It's a good thing we had another room because the second room was not ready until well after 6PM. This is my pet peeve -- waiting for my room! And from a Marriott? Shame shame.To the defense of the reception staff, they were embarrassed. I just told them to relax because I was going to dinner and would use the other room for now. And they did try to get the two rooms near one another -- just around the corner.The hotel is large and well-placed off the interstate, only blocks from the &quot;L.&quot; It's not far from a great forest preserve that we used for our morning walk/run. We came back for breakfast -- not include -- and very expensive for what you get on the buffet.The staff was very pleasant this morning, with a quick &quot;good morning&quot; and &quot;have a good day.&quot; And there wasn't anything really bad but I just didn't get a good feeling about the hotel. Our second room smelled soooo bad. The blinds were hanging off. Our shower head was a hair away from exploding. Still, the room was clean. The baths were marble. The price was right ($119). What was my problem? Perhaps it was the design. I am not really into that European orange and beige. The living room was small as was the bedroom. But that's not usually enough for me to complain on my Trip Advisor Forum. Now that I think about it, I think it was just the little things. It felt like cheap luxury... upscale wanna be. I don't think I would stay here again, but for a family looking for value, it worked. Just dont sweat the small stuff.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aug 25 2007 \\tGreat Hotel\\tThis was our first visit to Chicago, so we didn't know what to expect. We wanted a hotel which matched our needs, and we found it. The Renaissance was a comfortable hotel, had a free shuttle from the airport and the breakfast (using the &quot;Stay for Breakfast&quot; rate) made a great start to the day. We didn't want a car in the city, and we didn't need one....the Blue Line train was a short walk away from the hotel and although admittedly it did take a long time to reach downtown Chicago, apparently they are working towards fixing this. We were here for 3 days, a 3 day train ticket cost us $12 each....great value!! In a city like Chicago, all hotels are going to be expensive, so we chose to stay close to O'Hare, where the rates are cheaper and we think we had great value for money. There didn't seem a lot to do in the immediate area, but the hotel served meals (which we didn't try, except for the breakfast) and if you are using the hotel as an overnight before a flight or a base to explore the city the lack of surrounding restaurants or entertainment wouldn't be a problem. Ok, so it's not in the heart of the city, but what it lacks in central location it certainly makes up for in comfort, cleanliness and accessibility. The reception staff are excellent too...on arrival we asked the best way to get to the White Sox stadium, and almost before we had closed our door, the same receptionist was at the door with a computer printout. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, or recommend this hotel to our friends.\\t\\n\",\n",

       " 'Aug 5 2007 \\tGo someplace else\\tIf you use Trip Advisor much, you may know how many reviews I write. I travel significantly for business and write a review after almost every stay. I stayed at this hotel with my family (5 rooms total) and this, by far, was my worst experience all year. Here is the text of an e-mail I wrote to their business sales manager and director of operations. It sums up my experience.Molly  You have a tough job. I booked 5 rooms for a family get together this past weekend at your property and we dont plan on ever coming back. While youre e-mail is addressed to my father-in-law because he came in on Thursday, Im the GOLD Marriott member. Ill be platinum later this year, Im platinum with Holiday Inn, and Silver with Hilton. I can tell you for a FACT, your hotel is the WORST property Ive stayed at all year. On Saturday, I spoke with the manager twice about all of the hotel problems and nothing of substance was done. The manager even told me hed have the Front Desk Manager contact me when they came in because they had more seniority. No contact was ever made.If you care to improve your property, heres some pointers.1)Train the front desk to acknowledge the reward members. All the surveys I get from Marriott ask this question, your hotel didnt say a word.2)I had two rooms in my name and you placed us on the 4th and 12th floors. I thought maybe the property was so booked thats all that was left but my brother-in-law checked in after I did and was placed on the 12th floor. He had the same room type as our room on the 4th.3)When my teenage son was making his bed up he found only a blanket in the extra bedding packet. A call to your service line resolved it but we never should have needed to make the call. Weve stayed in numerous properties where hes used the extra bedding and this is the first time sheets were missing.4)Whoever decided cool and warm are good choices for HVAC obviously never stays in a hotel. Not having a digital HVAC system is a disgrace!5)I did not have a morning paper.6)You charge for the internet, another disgrace. Charging for the internet is similar to the energy charges hotels tried several years ago. This may look like a money maker now, but travelers remember when properties take advantage of them via fees. This is an unjustified fee and will come back to haunt you in the long run.7)Our room had a wet spot on the floor between the beds when we checked in. 8)Saturday morning there were no towels for the pool. I had to wait more than 20 minutes after asking the front desk.9)The hot tub in your pool area didnt work.10)After returning to our room from the pool Saturday morning, we found over a half dozen insects of some sort on the walls and ceiling of our room. The on duty manager captured them in a cup for your maintenance staff.11)When we started to shower up on Saturday morning the tub handle fell off. I showed this to your manager on duty and maintenance staff when they were removing the bugs from our room and they promised to fix it. A simple screw is all that was needed. The job was never completed.The manager on duty suggested I e-mail john Harper with my concerns, which Ive done because this property is an embarrassment to the Marriott name. However, your staff, through their inattention to my issued, has created a significant amount of ill will. When I check into a Marriott property, I have a set of expectations. Those expectations are based on my pervious experiences at Marriott properties. All that I can conclude from my experience is that Mr. Harper doesnt know how to manage a hotel or you have serious staffing issues. Either way something needs to change if you plan on succeeding. Many people will try your hotel because of its proximity to the airport, Marriott name, etc. Anyone who has the experience our group does will never come back.\\t\\n',\n",

When I was going back to the airport the shuttle was in time and it worked very well. I stayed in a standard room with a king bed. It was clean, fresh, had a safe, it was large enough for me, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was very big, and it was good water pressure in the shower. It was very quiet and I could not here much from other guests at the hotel. The air condition was quiet and worked very well. The room had two TVs with enough channels, and it had a nice sofa as well.On the premises it was a good restaurant and a nice pub. The lobby was large and you could have a seat there and relax. The staff was very nice and the four elevators were fast and efficient. I asked for a late check out and it was no problem. The only small complaint I have is that the internet access at the business center was rather expensive.

We were able to get a room through Priceline for $60 a night plus $20 a night for parking. Even considering that we were 50 minutes away from the downtown loop, it was well worth it to stay here, especially at the great per-night price we had.The El was just minutes from the hotel and the El and the buses are SO easy to use in Chicago. We bought the three day pass for $12 per person and used the heck out of it. We never waited more than 7 minutes for transportation and usually it was way less that that.Our room on the 9th floor looked exactly like the 'candid photos' that other reviewers have posted. We loved the spacious, new bathroom and the comfortable beds. Having a suite was a big plus, too. There was ample drawer and closet space (two closets.)The ONLY thing that we didn't like was the decorating and that may just be our personal preference. The living room section was very 'impersonal and cold' in our opinion. As another reviewer mentioned, it looked a bit like an office waiting room. The bedroom didn't feel quite so 'cold.'We would definitely stay at the Renaissance again, especially if the price differential was sizeable between a hotel downtown and the Renaissance, since the commute wasn't bad at all.We didn't hear airplanes, even though they were taking-off directly over the hotel. DIdn't hear the highway or the El trains, either. We didn't hear anything!\\t\\n\",\n",

The hotel is 16 stories and is located next to I-90, the El train, and about 1 mile from O'Hare-directly in the flight path depending on wind.When I arrived, I was greeted by the nice staff at the front desk and given a room on the Club Floor, Room 1625. Upon entering, you are in the living area of the room. There was an arm chair, 2 little square tables, a sofa (sofa bed), desk, chair, TV and a mini-armoire that contained a little refrigerator and an in-room safe. The Club Lounge would be closed for the weekend, so I was given coupons for a free &quot;full service&quot; breakfast. This room faced west toward O'Hare. Something bugged me about the living room, but it took a while to figure it out. The bedroom featured a king-sized bed, another TV and a closet containing an iron/board , clothes steamer/refresher and a robe. The bathroom was fairly large, with a stall shower (no tub) that was at least 3.5 feet x 5.5 feet, with a hand-held shower. The problems with the shower are that 1) the door opens out so the water gets all over the floor. 2) there is no handle on the inside of the door 3) no place to sit to shave your legs ladies! and 4) it is kind of dark! Plus, unless you are about a size 6, the robe won't fit! And, as the day went on, I noticed several other things wrong with the room. Honestly, I had higher expectations of the Renaissance, based partly on the other reviews here, and I was let down.The carpet had 3 very large stains on it just inside the door. The door itself was difficult to open and close. In the corner of the shower, there was a lot of mold on the grout between the tiles near the floor. Water pressure was minimal water pressure at best, the toilet seat was very loose and the A/C smelled of mildew all the time. Wound up keeping it off most of the day. There were crumbs on the floor between the tables and the furniture was really beaten up. The table was cracking and the desk had big gouges on it, and on the legs. For a Club Level room,. the place was really not up to Marriott standards. At this point, I finally realized what I disliked about the living area. The way it was set up made me feel like I was sitting in someone's office! Hard to explain, but I was really not comfortable.The bed, part of Marriott's new bedding package, was fairly comfortable, but neither the feather bed on top of the mattress nor the comforter were very fluffy and full. These both need to be washed and fluffed. Honestly, I have had regular blankets that are thicker. Yes, it is getting warm out, but I like to have a cold room and then a nice, fluffy down quilt!I gave the front desk the list of problems with the room. I really hate moving rooms, but the gal insisted that I go eat breakfast and stop back for a new room. Breakfast was another story. The coupon said &quot;full service&quot; meaning I should be able to order off the menu. Well, I was told I had to get the buffet. It wasn't bad. Actually, my omelet was cooked in real, melted butter and it was very good. But, my server did not ask me if I wanted toast or an English muffin (there was no toaster as is standard for Marriotts), nor did he get me Orange juice. I did get a little shot of strawberry smoothie which was good.The buffet had eggs, bacon (cold and soggy), sausage, fruit, cereals, oatmeal and cream of wheat, breakfast potatoes (with peppers and onions of course-yuck) and some muffins and coffee cake. The coffee cakes really looked to be of the Entenmann's or Sara Lee variety like you get in a grocery store. Why? They had those tell-tale aluminum foil cake pan marks on the side. Eh. The chef was very nice, the server was just OK.Returned to the desk and was moved to room 1630 which is one of the corner suites. Looks just like the photos on the Marriott website except there are no drapes, just 2 types of shades-a sheer and a black-out shade. The sheer shade in the bedroom would not go up! This room was very large. The living area was the size of a large hotel room itself! Closet, TV, dining-room table with 6 chairs, a stereo and lots of speakers (I guess you could use it for some sort of surround sound but I am not so inclined), desk, couch and arm chair. Its funny though, there is no lamp close to the sofa for reading! There is a big, ceiling lamp over the dining table, and a desk lamp but nothing close enough to sit and read at night. Hmm. At the risk of sounding mean, Marriott needs some women designing their hotels. Or at least people with common sense who actually USE their hotels!The bedroom had a king bed, TV, another closet and some drawers. The alarm clock even has directions! The bathroom here had an actual tub, with the hand held shower. And, on the inside of one of the doors, a lovely dirty kids' handprint! Great! This is supposed to be an even better room and the housekeeper doesn't check the inside of the doors! Details people!!! The robe in this room was thick, fluffy and of a size that would fit most normal-sized humans! At least this room didn't have that mildew smell from the A/C. The view was nice. You can see the Chicago skyline in the distance. And, you get to see the highway and the El! The hotel is very noisy. Not so much from other guests, but the trains, cars and planes can get on your nerves. I can live with airplane noise, but if you are a light sleeper, ear plugs are a MUST!The &quot;wired for business&quot; package for internet and local and long distance (domestic) calls is $9.95 per day which isn't bad. Parking is $20 per day. Food prices were a bit high for dinner. Some of the drink prices in the bar were reasonable. They had some featured drinks that were $7.00 and considering the amount and types of liquor in them, this was a reasonable price. (One had Patron tequila for which another Marriott charged $10 a shot! This stuff is super expensive!!)There is a Bennigans across the parking lot and the hotel is a very short walk to the Blue Line trains. (Cumberland station). You can purchase visitor's passes at the Cumberland station. They are in a different machine than the regular train/bus tickets. For $5, you can get unlimited rides on the El, CTA and PACE buses. Also, you can get either a 2, 3 or 7 day pass for $9, $12, and $20 respectively. These passes are a great deal considering it is $4 round trip to Chicago. And, if you ride the bus a couple times in a day, your pass will more than pay for itself. You can also get these passes at O'Hare, Union Station and a couple other places. The hotel does have a free shuttle to the airport. Never had to wait longer than about 10 minutes. Overall, the hotel staff was very nice, and it is a lovely property. However, it needs to be cleaner with respect to both rooms and public areas. For instance, there was &quot;stuff&quot; on the rug outside the elevator on the 16th floor for over 48 hours. This should have been vacuumed up! Breakfast on subsequent days was better; although it took until the final day for the server to ask if I wanted toast! I met the restaurant manager and spoke with him at length about my issues. He actually gave me a coupon for a complimentary appetizer in the bar since the Club Lounge was closed. I had steak quesadillas that were very good. The bar was empty, save for one other couple. Service was friendly but less than attentive. Wound up leaving due to the foul language being used by both the woman and man sitting down the bar. I will skip the lecture about not using filthy language in public. Please, show some class! There was a billing error at checkout. I was charged for too many nights (I had a coupon for a free night) and I was charged for internet service for two days, which was only used once. The person at the desk seemed a bit annoyed that she had to fix it for me. Perhaps it was just too early? I would say that 98% of the staff was wonderful. There are just a couple people who need some extra training in customer service.With a good rate, I may consider returning, but there are other hotels that I think are in better shape than this Renaissance. This is supposed to be a more upscale brand than a regular, full service Marriott. In my opinion, the rooms are a little too cold and stark. I guess this is the new trend, but it makes this place seem too much like an office&quot; and less like a hotel. Yes, it is geared to business travelers, but there is a fine line between office, and a hotel room with space to work. To me this place is an office that happens to have a bed. It wasnt horrible, just not the best. Again, this is just my opinion. Different strokes for different folks. Most people love it, I didnt.\\t\\n\",\n",
       " \"May 8 2007 \\tGreat room Cheerful people!\\tI just stayed at the Renaissance O'Hare last weekend, and it was a great experience, overall.Everyone I spoke to at the hotel was courteous and friendly. There were some issues (discussed below), but none of them illicited any bad behavior from the hotel staff.I flew in at 6am, and they had a room waiting for me! The suite was spacious, with a huge shower, 2 TVs, and a great view from the 5th floor. I had the corner room that was close to the elevators and right across from the vending machines, but that didn't bother me. In fact, I loved the location! I never heard much noise from the hallway or outside. The bed was comfy and I slept well.The train station into the city is a very short walk away (just across the parking lot), which was perfect! There is also a Starbucks in the lobby for that morning coffee fix.I ordered room service for breakfast on my last morning, and the food was quite good. Also, the shuttle service to the airport was a great perk.Here are my only complaints (which is why I couldn't give it a perfect rating):-When I arrived at the shuttle pickup area, I called the hotel and was told I'd just missed the 6am shuttle, but one would be arriving in 15 mins. Their shuttle is supposed to pick up every 20 mins., starting at 6am. Well, 15 mins. passed and there was no shuttle. I also found out another person who was standing at the same door had also been waiting for the shuttle...since before 6am. I called the hotel again, and was told the shuttle had come by twice already, but we'd never seen it. Finally, at 6:40, the shuttle arrived. So, don't count on this service to be on-time.-I left my hotel room at 10am and was gone until 10pm. Of course, I expected maid service to come by in my absence. When I got back, I found the room exactly as I'd left it! When I complained about this to the front desk on my way out, the receptionist told me that I have to call and request maid service because sometimes they don't clean the rooms! I've been in much cheaper hotels that had maid service every day.\\t\\n\",\n",

where he took good care of us Our bellman Shawn was friendly polite and very knowledgeable Shawn waited while I checked in and the sons were given their Trump Kids amenity The front desk staff was professional yet it seemed to throw them a curve when I made a request to change my room  yet remain in the same roomtype categoryWe had reserved a King Suite with a city view and reservations had assigned us to a room ending in 28 which I knew to be facing the IBM Plaza  something I didnt want  so I requested to be moved to a room ending in 02 which had a commanding view of River North One may access the floorplans in advance of the stay at wwwtrumpchicagohotelcomAccommodationsinteractivefloorplansaspThe request was accommodated and Shawn showed us to our room and explained everything from the pushbutton Do Not Disturb sign to the espresso machine which makes really awful espresso I must say He took his time and made us feel like VIPs Our suite was spacious and comfortable decorated in muted grays and the furniture is some kind of dark wood The view was mostly north along Wabash with a small view of Lake Michigan and the Hancock as well It was nice to have two flatpanel HD televisions in the suite with a DVD player for each It was also nice to have two full baths The linens were crisp and comfortable My wife though the bed was a bit soft but it was fine for me Our

settled we went straight to the pool which has a commanding view east down the Chicago River to Lake Michigan Unfortunately there was no telephone in the pool for us to order a cocktail so I had to walk out to the spa area to do so It took a halfhour to deliver the drinks which we found later was the exception rather than the rule The server had also bought the milk and cookies amenity for our boys and wondered if we would prefer that he deliver to our room instead We did prefer that and he took care of it It was really a nice touch  each boys name was written on the plate in chocolate and they told us later it was the best cookie they ever hadWe used inroom dining for one breakfast and a dinner I was impressed that Trump stocks Spiegelau crystal in the kitchen The full complement of

the food simply marvelous Trump clearly has its roomservice down My wife forgot to include a bottle of wine with the dinner and it was delivered within 05 minutes of our order It was wonderful to have a refrigerator in the room and we brought a bottle of bubbly for us sodas and juices for the kids and had a place to stow our deepdish pizza leftoversChef concierge Joseph Coston was helpful with CTA bus information and dining options and concierge Kathleen Zubroski had scored excellent Mary Poppins tickets for us in advance of our arrival The Trump Concierge staff is the best Ive seen in Chicago and weve stayed at all of the luxury hotels with the exception of the Park HyattMy spa treatment was in a word transformational I can highly recommend therapist Jon Meltzer The amenities in the spa are firstclass and the lockershower facilities are the finest Ive seen It was neat to be able to choose an aromatherapy for the steam room from a tray of three options The Kohler multihead shower with music and lighting in the mens locker room is especially wonderful Chilled bottled water was in abundance as were towels and grooming materials I didnt use the Sauna This would have been a perfect stay had it not been for ongoing issues with Housekeeping1 I asked Housekeeping for a larger bathrobe and slippers as the standard robe and slippers dont fit me I was told they would be delivered promptly but they were not I ended up having to get a larger robber from the Spa locker room and never did find slippers that fit 2 On our first night in the room the turndown staff showed up at 5pm just after we had returned from the pool We informed the person that we didnt want any turndown service during our stay until 630pm at the earliest At 600 pm  turndown comes to the door again We send them away again At 630 when we are leaving for Mary Poppins they arrive for service We ask them to be sure to leave extra pillows and blankets for the boys on the sofabed We arrive back from the show at 1030 pm to find one pillow and one blanket on the sofabed To their credit within 10 minutes we had the extras we had requested 3 On our second night turndown shows up AGAIN at 5pm and we tell them AGAIN no service earlier than 630pm AGAIN another knock on the door at 6pm We ask them to come back at 630 when we plan to leave and make clear that the extra pillow and blanket we had saved from the previous night is to be used AGAIN We arrive back at the hotel from dinner at 830pm to find one pillow and one blanket on the sofabed AGAIN we must call for additional pillow and blanket 4 On our third and final evening in the hotel we were tired from a day of Lincoln Park Zoo and shopping so we went to our room at 345 to find the housekeeping staff just starting to service the room OK  we decided to go to Rebar for a drink and enjoyed another nice view of the river They served us a small tray of nibbling items including my fave  pitted kalamata olives The sushi menu looked good  and expensive  but we only wanted a drink and the view We returned to our room at 430 and were disappointed to find housekeeping still there This time we remained in our room to ensure that an extra pillow and blanket were delivered and the sofabed was made up And guess what  at 5pm turndown knocked on the door AGAIN This is a fivestar hotel for crying out loud They are supposed to note these kinds of things after being told once I didnt get a chance to register any complaint with the management before we checked out because we had a schedule to keep However I was able to note the issues on the follow up guest survey I received via email the day after checkout Bottom line  we would stay at the Trump again as 95 of the stay was really great You cannot beat the location and with the exception of Housekeeping staff members were responsive and gracious\\t\\n',\n",

       " 'May 12 2009 \\t5 stars  zero disappointment\\tAll I can say is wow We stay at hotels a lot And every time Ive stayed at a luxury hotel in the past Ive been disappointed The Trump changed all that At 199 a night on a special Travelzoo deal I decided to give the Trump a try and indulge a little for a Mothers Day stay with my kids I was impressed from the moment we arrived We valet parked and our bags were brought inside for a smooth check in  every staff member addressed us by name Kids were given backpacks with cotton candy and coloring books Bellman brought us to our room as we got off the elevator I could tell we were headed to the river side of the property I was so surprised amp pleased to see we had been upgraded to a larger partial river view room The room was kind of wedge shaped so the panoramic views from the floor to ceiling windows were amazing Furnishings were in a muted purple with taupes and grays and looked just like the pictures on the website I had ordered some amenities gourmet popcorn candy jar and chocolate covered strawberries ahead of time to surprise my kids and all were in the room just like I had requested A few minutes after we arrived at our room the bellman returned with little stuffed animals pink and blue cows with a Trump Kids logo for each of the kids  told me they had inadvertantly been left out of their backpacks at check in  I was later told that the kids names and ages hadnt been updated into my profile we only booked one day prior I asked about robes and slippers for the kids and housekeeping brought them a few minutes later We opted to relax and order a room service lunch  kids had a burger amp fries and grilled cheese with tomato soup I got prosciutto di parma with buffalo mozzarella on grilled baguette Food was amazing and presented with real silverware and a fresh orchid The server asked if we would be dining at Sixteen later I told him I thought the experience would likely be lost on the kids but he mentioned that anything on the kids room service menu could be ordered at the restaurant  Ill keep this in mind for next time As it stood we kept out reservations at Harry Carays  an easy 2 block walk from the hotel After lunch we checked out the pool You have to sign in at the spa on the 14th floor to use the pool but the staff was very helpful and personally escorted us to the locker rooms Kids enjoyed a nice swim while I relaxed and enjoyed the views of the Chicago River amp Lake Michigan Headed back to our room to get ready for dinner and found housekeeping was already there to turn down the bed They dont leave wrapped chocolates on the pillow rather a lovely glass tray of assorted chocolates and a gumdrop my kids fought over Before swimming we had asked for a game console and we found a Playstation 3 and a few games had been delivered while we were out Kids had a little trouble with the controllers but maintenance came up quickly and brought the connection cable we were missing Kids enjoyed a Walle game while I got ready When we came back from dinner we found the sofa bed had been made up just like we requested at checkin What we did not find were cookies for this kids which I thought were part of the Trump Kids amenities A quick phone call to the front desk and a few minutes later in room dining brought up 2 large chocolate chunk cookies with glasses of milk Kids couldnt even finish them After the kids fell asleep I took a bath  the bathroom is lovely with a TV in the mirror as well as an adjoining tub and shower Tub was deep and long with a waterfall faucet and I was able to indulge and enjoy a long bath  I am 5 10quot and the tub was quite comfortable  this is rare for me The shower has a rainfall head as well as a separate handheld shower massage Robes for adults were in the bathroom and a digital scale and hair dryer were available as well Bath amenities were very ample size  much larger than most hotels Bed was so comfy  I loved the pillows but there was a pillow menu if you wanted something different Kids couldnt wait to wake me up and open the curtains  all controlled with convenient wall switches The view was even more impressive than the day before We ordered room service for breakfast  my breakfast would have served all 3 of us if my kids werent so picky I ordered a quotHeart Healthyquot combination for 27 which included choice of juices from orange to cherry pomegranate a blueberry muffin with assorted jams amp honey a large fruit plate with 4 kinds of berries cantaloupe honeydew pineapple and oranges a huge bowl of Swiss Mueslix with pecan halves slivered almonds chopped apple and dried apricot and coffee tea or skim milk I didnt eat half of it  just so much food Kids pancakes and french toast were 9 each but served with more fresh berries We had time for another swim before checking out and wished we had booked more than one night It was such an enjoyable stay Had a few glitches at check out  our breakfast charges werent on the bill and the website had promised business cards for the kids with their names printed on them We had lunch and shopping planned so we agreed to store our bags and come back later to get the kids cards and my corrected bill Was so pleased to find out the valet would keep our car until 5PM included in the 52 daily rate from when we checked in  we took full advantage I was handed an envelope when we got back  they recognized us I just assumed the envelope had the cards for the kids and my bill but once home found only the cards Im sure they sorted the bill out and if I dont get a copy in the mail Ill give them a call and ask Our stay was not seamless but whenever things didnt go quite right staff went above and beyond to rectify matters and were always apologetic and cordial What I loved most about the Trump was the lack of pretentiousness As far as I could see all the guests were treated well and addressed by name Even bell staff in the elevator greeted us and asked us how we were enjoying our stay I felt like we were being welcomed back rather than staying there for the first time It was really a delightful experience This is what a luxury hotel should be  friendly professional staff gorgeous rooms great food and perfect location This hotel is a real gem and we cant wait to go back\\t\\n',\n",

       " 'Jan 7 2009 \\tLetting things slip\\tI have been a lurker on this site for a couple years and after my recent stay at Trump I decided that I needed to write a review about my experienceI have stayed at Trump three times now The first two times were phenomenal My family and I have always stayed in the 46 type room between the 1923 floors We love the view of the Wrigley Building and the magnificent Chicago lake front and river The rooms were always flawless the service was great and there was not much more that we could ask for Upon arrival our favorite doorman MK greeted us by name said he was so glad that we were back and helped us to check in as usual It was a great start to what should have been a fabulous stay Then things started going downhill first of all we had to wait a good 5 minutes before anyone came to the front desk Where was all the staff One of the male concierges came over and started chatting with us he was charismatic and let us know that if there was anything he could do for us to please let him know Well there is something he could have done he could have either checked us in or got someone to check us in Instead of doing either of those things he went back to his desk and started chatting with one of his coworkers When someone finally did check us in they were very nice She acknowledged that we were return guests and said she was glad that we had come back to stay at Trump Then she gave us our keys I need to stop here for a second The last two times I have stayed at this hotel not only was I not handed my keys I had someone take my family up to the room show us where things were and of course open the door for us As I took the key I didnt think too much of it but after everything that happened during our stay I can now see how our stay was destined for disaster from the get go When we got to our room everything was beautiful as usual our youngest daughter called down to attach to see if she could get an XBOX and they obliged two hours later it wasnt in our room and when we called down to inquire we found out that they had left for the night In previous stays we had always called the attach desk as late as 1100pm with someone there to grant our wishes and now at 900pm no one was there It wasnt even a holiday Before heading out for some shopping my husband and I decided we wanted to stop by the concierge desk to see our favorite concierge Alexzandra To our dismay we found out that she was recently transferred to another property When we did ask the concierge questions the girl either didnt know the answer or was robotic I dont ask that much of a concierge but when I want to go to a fine dining option that isnt as mainstream as Charlie Trotters I expect the concierge to deliver and she did not As a family we heavily rely on a concierge We like to be able to throw out an idea and have the concierge make it happen and on this trip things just werent the same We decided to go to restaurants we had already been to since the two concierges we spoke to could not come up with anything that we hadnt already been to My oldest daughter is a fashion forward 16 year old who loves exploring Chicagos indie neighborhoods Normally the concierge would come up with a detailed plan of attack for her stay but no one seemed interested in providing a level of service that actually required some thought Needless to say we were disappointed and she was boredI think the most disappointing service issue we had was that there was an overall lack of attention given to my family The only person who called my family by name was MK all of the other staff members didnt even make an effort to address us by name No one was particularly rude but at the five star level I want extraordinary and that is what I used to get at the Trump and it is a shame that that is no longer the caseDuring our first two trips to the Trump service seemed to be of the utmost importance to this hotel they had staff everywhere They had great staff Now it seems like they are cutting back on their most valuable asset and forgetting why their customers stay there I dont stay at a hotel to be left alone I stay at a hotel to be pampered I want somebody to open the door for me I want the concierge to know my name and I want to be escorted to my room When I am paying thousands of dollars a night I expect the best and Trump did not deliverMr Trump you have a lot invested in this property I advise you to go and stay there I think you should see what your hard earned money has bought you This hotel is slipping I have quite honestly received better service at Holiday Inns then I did on my last stay at your hotel We used to LOVE your hotel my daughters begged me to bring them back here but after the service lack of we received on our most recent visit we will be going back to the Peninsula as they have continually met our needs without a bat of the eyeI dont want a refund for my stay I want my time back and that is far more valuable than any monetary sum this hotel could refund me\\t\\n',\n",

on Lake Shore Drive We got a river view suite and I think it was about 50000 a nightI have to say the hotel is STUNNING Our initial room was great but noisy there is still ongoing construction The front desk at the Trump obliged in giving us a new room and it was breathtaking Everything is very modern and new and in keeping with the sleek modernity that you would see at hotels like the Mercer in NYCsleek but not overwhelming or intimidating The room had the BEST Chicago viewNavy Pier and the Chicago River and it was mostly unobstructed and endless And a real bonus was that the windows open just a bitwe are sticklers for fresh air That allowed just enough air in without there being a hazard for those of you with small childrenThe room one bedroom apartment was clean and roomy and had everything you could want we had a suite that had two full baths with absolute top of the line fixturesamenities like a television in the mirror I want that for home marble showers AND separate baths There was a full kitchen with top of the line appliances Miele dishwasher for example and also free Nespresso which would be a real bonus for families for childrenSpeaking of children when we notified the hotel that we would have a baby visiting us for the day they immediately put not only a great crib in our room but a high chair a diaper genie and soap and lotion etc for the baby We really appreciated that gestureThe swimming pool is also great for kids and they are very friendly there and will provide swimming noodles and amenities for those with small children Adjacent to the swimming pool btw with a breathtaking view the SpaFitness room is absolutely top of the linebrand new and plentiful equipment Pilates classes and fresh water fruit infused and bottled The last day we were there they replaced the bottled water with Trump Ice water which had a picture of Donald Trump on it We thought it very funny It is so neat to exercise in a great location high up overlooking all of ChicagoThe restaurant however is a work in progress The staff was not yet fully trained the water tasted like chlorine and they kept trying to fill my glass with it even though we had bottled water and the menu was HORRIBLY expensive 5000 for an entree but not inspired We actually had a hard time trying to figure out what to order because nothing sounded interesting enough to pay for Before we were finished it was clear they wanted us to leave and started to fold linens in our vicinity which seems strange when you are paying 40000 for dinner But the view is greatHowever the fact that I liked the hotel as much as I did makes me sad to continue this review and end up only giving this hotel 3 stars The first incident that blew our minds was what will be known in our family as the quotracist doorman incidentquot On the early afternoon of Friday June 20th it began to rain just as my family stopped by to pick us up for lunch Earlier in the day I had gone out and it had rained and I asked for an umbrella at the first counter where the doorpersons are stationed They happily obliged one person was a nice older African American woman with braids I returned the umbrella as we came in and thought nothing of itAt about 1pm however when I asked for two umbrellas we were now a motley group of 4 toddlers and 6 adults without an umbrella amongst us the same woman manning the door attempted to go behind the desk and retrieve them but the man behind the counter looked at us stopped her and said We are all out of umbrellas If you need an umbrella you will have to go up to your room to get one Fair enough We understood that if it was raining umbrellas may be in limited supply My husband went upstairs to get an umbrella But in the meantime the same man behind the counter took out all these new umbrellas and started unwrapping them They were there all alongWhat was more HUMILIATING was that he came from behind the counter and gave an umbrella each to two white women who hadnt even left the lobby and HADNT EVEN ASKED FOR THEM YET I was shocked but I was actually more humiliated Both my 4 year old daughter and my 65 year old mother asked me why the man said there were no more umbrellas when clearly there were How could I tell my daughter there were no more umbrellas for people like us Did he not like us because we were the wrong color or because he didnt think we were worthy of the hotel I have my suspicions but dont you think that was awful At least the African American coworker who was clearly embarrassed then proceeded to go behind the counter and give us all umbrellas But he really ruined my day and I felt really low I thought about why he would do such a thing in front of my family all dayThat same day at 830 I went down to ReBar their signature bar that they tout as serving exotic cocktails for a quick cocktail with my sister I felt we were both dressed well she was in a summer dress and I was in a pucci dress When we sat down a waitress came to us and said quotIm sorry but this table is bottle service only after 900pm My sister responded that it was only 830 The waitress served us but you could tell she wasnt happy about it I can tell you that we looked like everyone else in the bar the bar btw skews middleaged and distinctly suburban I definitely was one of the younger people there My sister who already had the quotumbrellaquot incident started talking about how she felt uncomfortable being there and so as soon as the drink came we took it upstairs But the kicker is that my husband and myself came back an hour and half later and guess what The couple now sitting in the same seats we had earlier occupied was just drinking simple cocktails Where was the bottle service Beats meInitially I was willing to believe that these two incidents were an aberration and that there is no pattern No one wants to accuse a hotel of something like casual racism in this day and age But after speaking with the manager I am not so sure They say all behaviors emanate from the top and if this is the case I have to say the manager could do a better job at dispelling my suspicionsWhen I wrote the manager about this both he T Colm OCallaghan and his assistant manager Jerome tried repeatedly to contact me I assumed that they were contacting me to apologize but what actually ended up happening is that Mr OCallaghan at first apologized and then tried to intimate that I had misread the situation He kept trying to tell me that what happened didnt happen He said they simply ran out of umbrellas HELLO I was there They NEVER ran out of umbrellas the guy just didnt want to give us the umbrellas he had He kept trying to spin it as a misunderstanding but this guy just didnt want to waste his dwindling resources umbrellas on the likes of usAs for the bar incident he said that certain areas have bottle service after a certain hour But when I told him that hour hadnt been reached she didnt want to serve us at 830pm because she said bottle service starts at 9 and when I came back an hour and half later the people now sitting at the same seats were just having cocktails he didnt want to talk about it Weird Instead of diffusing the situation he made me feel as if he didnt want to hear what really happened and that he thought I was a silly deluded personSo in the end this hotel gets 3 stars 5 stars for the hotel

       " 'Oct 2 2007 \\tOverall a good deal\\tI stayed in this hotel during the last weekend of September It is really close to Ohare airport So that is a big positive Overall the hotel itself is very clean and looks to be in excellent condition There is a Starbucks in the lobby area The rooms and bathrooms were very nice suite setup The 24 hour gym is very well kept and easily accessible Parking is steep at 20 a night It is a garage that is right next to the hotel but it seems like a bit of a scam to be that expensive I arrived on a Friday night and the receptionist at the front counter that I checked in with was very rude and seemed like she was flustered or perhaps working too many hours This was my first encounter at the hotel and this certainly did not paint a good picture in my mind However after speaking with the hotel manager that was on for the night I was very satisfied The manager apologized for that employees behavior and waived the parking fees for the weekend I think that the specific girl at the front counter was an employee that was either having a bad day or just had a bad attitude in general Either way every other employee that I encountered was extremely nice and helpfulI did not use room service or the in house restaurant barso Im unable to comment about that I unfortunately had the bad experience with the receptionist but I think that was truly an isolated incident Parking rates are a bit steep considering the fact that this is not anywhere near downtown In summary the hotel itself is very niceprobably rate it around 35 out of 5\\t\\n',\n",

       " 'May 30 2007 \\tExpected better a little too officelike LONG review\\tRecently stayed in this hotel for 3 nights over Memorial Day The hotel is 16 stories and is located next to I90 the El train and about 1 mile from OHaredirectly in the flight path depending on windWhen I arrived I was greeted by the nice staff at the front desk and given a room on the Club Floor Room 1625 Upon entering you are in the living area of the room There was an arm chair 2 little square tables a sofa sofa bed desk chair TV and a miniarmoire that contained a little refrigerator and an inroom safe The Club Lounge would be closed for the weekend so I was given coupons for a free quotfull servicequot breakfast This room faced west toward OHare Something bugged me about the living room but it took a while to figure it out The bedroom featured a kingsized bed another TV and a closet containing an ironboard  clothes steamerrefresher and a robe The bathroom was fairly large with a stall shower no tub that was at least 35 feet x 55 feet with a handheld shower The problems with the shower are that 1 the door opens out so the water gets all over the floor 2 there is no handle on the inside of the door 3 no place to sit to shave your legs ladies and 4 it is kind of dark Plus unless you are about a size 6 the robe wont fit And as the day went on I noticed several other things wrong with the room Honestly I had higher expectations of the Renaissance based partly on the other reviews here and I was let downThe carpet had 3 very large stains on it just inside the door The door itself was difficult to open and close In the corner of the shower there was a lot of mold on the grout between the tiles near the floor Water pressure was minimal water pressure at best the toilet seat was very loose and the AC smelled of mildew all the time Wound up keeping it off most of the day There were crumbs on the floor between the tables and the furniture was really beaten up The table was cracking and the desk had big gouges on it and on the legs For a Club Level room the place was really not up to Marriott standards At this point I finally realized what I disliked about the living area The way it was set up made me feel like I was sitting in someones office Hard to explain but I was really not comfortableThe bed part of Marriotts new bedding package was fairly comfortable but neither the feather bed on top of the mattress nor the comforter were very fluffy and full These both need to be washed and fluffed Honestly I have had regular blankets that are thicker Yes it is getting warm out but I like to have a cold room and then a nice fluffy down quiltI gave the front desk the list of problems with the room I really hate moving rooms but the gal insisted that I go eat breakfast and stop back for a new room Breakfast was another story The coupon said quotfull servicequot meaning I should be able to order off the menu Well I was told I had to get the buffet It wasnt bad Actually my omelet was cooked in real melted butter and it was very good But my server did not ask me if I wanted toast or an English muffin there was no toaster as is standard for Marriotts nor did he get me Orange juice I did get a little shot of strawberry smoothie which was goodThe buffet had eggs bacon cold and soggy sausage fruit cereals oatmeal and cream of wheat breakfast potatoes with peppers and onions of courseyuck and some muffins and coffee cake The coffee cakes really looked to be of the Entenmanns or Sara Lee variety like you get in a grocery store Why They had those telltale aluminum foil cake pan marks on the side Eh The chef was very nice the server was just OKReturned to the desk and was moved to room 1630 which is one of the corner suites Looks just like the photos on the Marriott website except there are no drapes just 2 types of shadesa sheer and a blackout shade The sheer shade in the bedroom would not go up This room was very large The living area was the size of a large hotel room itself Closet TV diningroom table with 6 chairs a stereo and lots of speakers I guess you could use it for some sort of surround sound but I am not so inclined desk couch and arm chair Its funny though there is no lamp close to the sofa for reading There is a big ceiling lamp over the dining table and a desk lamp but nothing close enough to sit and read at night Hmm At the risk of sounding mean Marriott needs some women designing their hotels Or at least people with common sense who actually USE their hotelsThe bedroom had a king bed TV another closet and some drawers The alarm clock even has directions The bathroom here had an actual tub with the hand held shower And on the inside of one of the doors a lovely dirty kids handprint Great This is supposed to be an even better room and the housekeeper doesnt check the inside of the doors Details people The robe in this room was thick fluffy and of a size that would fit most normalsized humans At least this room didnt have that mildew smell from the AC The view was nice You can see the Chicago skyline in the distance And you get to see the highway and the El The hotel is very noisy Not so much from other guests but the trains cars and planes can get on your nerves I can live with airplane noise but if you are a light sleeper ear plugs are a MUSTThe quotwired for businessquot package for internet and local and long distance domestic calls is 995 per day which isnt bad Parking is 20 per day Food prices were a bit high for dinner Some of the drink prices in the bar were reasonable They had some featured drinks that were 700 and considering the amount and types of liquor in them this was a reasonable price One had Patron tequila for which another Marriott charged 10 a shot This stuff is super expensiveThere is a Bennigans across the parking lot and the hotel is a very short walk to the Blue Line trains Cumberland station You can purchase visitors passes at the Cumberland station They are in a different machine than the regular trainbus tickets For 5 you can get unlimited rides on the El CTA and PACE buses Also you can get either a 2 3 or 7 day pass for 9 12 and 20 respectively These passes are a great deal considering it is 4 round trip to Chicago And if you ride the bus a couple times in a day your pass will more than pay for itself You can also get these passes at OHare Union Station and a couple other places The hotel does have a free shuttle to the airport Never had to wait longer than about 10 minutes Overall the hotel staff was very nice and it is a lovely property However it needs to be cleaner with respect to both rooms and public areas For instance there was quotstuffquot on the rug outside the elevator on the 16th floor for over 48 hours This should have been vacuumed up Breakfast on subsequent days was better although it took until the final day for the server to ask if I wanted toast I met the restaurant manager and spoke with him at length about my issues He actually gave me a coupon for a complimentary appetizer in the bar since the Club Lounge was closed I had steak quesadillas that were very good The bar was empty save for one other couple Service was friendly but less than attentive Wound up leaving due to the foul language being used by both the woman and man sitting down the bar I will skip the lecture about not using filthy language in public Please show some class There was a billing error at checkout I was charged for too many nights I had a coupon for a free night and I was charged for internet service for two days which was only used once The person at the desk seemed a bit annoyed that she had to fix it for me Perhaps it was just too early I would say that 98 of the staff was wonderful There are just a couple people who need some extra training in customer serviceWith a good rate I may consider returning but there are other hotels that I think are in better shape than this Renaissance This is supposed to be a more upscale brand than a regular full service Marriott In my opinion the rooms are a little too cold and stark I guess this is the new trend but it makes this place seem too much like an officequot and less like a hotel Yes it is geared to business travelers but there is a fine line between office and a hotel room with space to work To me this place is an office that happens to have a bed It wasnt horrible just not the best Again this is just my opinion Different strokes for different folks Most people love it I didnt\\t\\n',\n",

       " 'Inconsistent Service\\tMy wife and I recently spent two nights at Trump while celebrating her 40th birthday We both came away from our stay with mixed emotions On the plus side the hotel has a great location as its situated on the river and only a short walk to the Mag Mile Millennium Park etc Our room was aesthetically appealing and quite comfortable particularly the bathroom which had a large shower and bath area In addition we were very satisfied with our spa service Soul to Soul though it was a tad bit expensiveWhile the hotel has a lot going for it there were too many minor irritations that left us with a negative impression Ill start with the 50night valet parking that others have mentioned in their reviews This seems outrageous to me Classic two part pricing where you get focused on the cost of the room and you end up paying a lot more because of other services Its probably worth the inconvenience to park across the street On the topic of getting nicked for other services we were erroneously charged for mini bar items that we never consumed they did remove this fee at check out Also while this is probably unique to our stay and not likely replicated by you a maintenance person barged into our room soon after we had arrived looking for a video game or some such nonsense that he thought someone had left behind turns out he was wrong He rang the bell once and was in the room rummaging around Good thing we had just arrived and were checking out the room otherwise it could have been really awkward Doesnt anybody knock anymoreAs I mentioned at the onset we were staying at the hotel celebrating a birthday The staff sent a bottle of champaign which was a very nice touch but the card wished us well on our wedding anniversary While the message was a bit off we drank the bottle of champaign anyway thank you very muchFinally our neighbors decided to crank up their stereo at 300am on the last night of our stay Maybe those Bose systems with the Ipod adapter are not such a great idea after allDecide for yourselves but for my money Ill take Four Seasons any day of the week Respect\\t\\n',\n",

       " 'Trump Towers above the rest  with one exception\\tWe enjoyed our stay at the Trump over Memorial Day weekend with one notable exception which I will get into later Our arrival was an indication of things to come  the valet took the car and let me know it could be delivered with 10 notice whenever I wished We recognized the bell captain Emanuel from his days at The Sofitel where he took good care of us Our bellman Shawn was friendly polite and very knowledgeable Shawn waited while I checked in and the sons were given their Trump Kids amenity The front desk staff was professional yet it seemed to throw them a curve when I made a request to change my room  yet remain in the same roomtype categoryWe had reserved a King Suite with a city view and reservations had assigned us to a room ending in 28 which I knew to be facing the IBM Plaza  something I didnt want  so I requested to be moved to a room ending in 02 which had a commanding view of River North One may access the floorplans in advance of the stay at wwwtrumpchicagohotelcomAccommodationsinteractivefloorplansaspThe request was accommodated and Shawn showed us to our room and explained everything from the pushbutton Do Not Disturb sign to the espresso machine which makes really awful espresso I must say He took his time and made us feel like VIPs Our suite was spacious and comfortable decorated in muted grays and the furniture is some kind of dark wood The view was mostly north along Wabash with a small view of Lake Michigan and the Hancock as well It was nice to have two flatpanel HD televisions in the suite with a DVD player for each It was also nice to have two full baths The linens were crisp and comfortable My wife though the bed was a bit soft but it was fine for me Our pillow menu requests were honored accurately and promptly even though we had requested a different room upon checkin This turned out to be the one thing that housekeeping got right After getting settled we went straight to the pool which has a commanding view east down the Chicago River to Lake Michigan Unfortunately there was no telephone in the pool for us to order a cocktail so I had to walk out to the spa area to do so It took a halfhour to deliver the drinks which we found later was the exception rather than the rule The server had also bought the milk and cookies amenity for our boys and wondered if we would prefer that he deliver to our room instead We did prefer that and he took care of it It was really a nice touch  each boys name was written on the plate in chocolate and they told us later it was the best cookie they ever hadWe used inroom dining for one breakfast and a dinner I was impressed that Trump stocks Spiegelau crystal in the kitchen The full complement of plates silver and kitchen tools were most welcome Inroom delivery time was accurate to the minute on both occasions The graciousness and competency of the server was most welcome and the quality of the food simply marvelous Trump clearly has its roomservice down My wife forgot to include a bottle of wine with the dinner and it was delivered within 05 minutes of our order It was wonderful to have a refrigerator in the room and we brought a bottle of bubbly for us sodas and juices for the kids and had a place to stow our deepdish pizza leftoversChef concierge Joseph Coston was helpful with CTA bus information and dining options and concierge Kathleen Zubroski had scored excellent Mary Poppins tickets for us in advance of our arrival The Trump Concierge staff is the best Ive seen in Chicago and weve stayed at all of the luxury hotels with the exception of the Park HyattMy spa treatment was in a word transformational I can highly recommend therapist Jon Meltzer The amenities in the spa are firstclass and the lockershower facilities are the finest Ive seen It was neat to be able to choose an aromatherapy for the steam room from a tray of three options The Kohler multihead shower with music and lighting in the mens locker room is especially wonderful Chilled bottled water was in abundance as were towels and grooming materials I didnt use the Sauna This would have been a perfect stay had it not been for ongoing issues with Housekeeping1 I asked Housekeeping for a larger bathrobe and slippers as the standard robe and slippers dont fit me I was told they would be delivered promptly but they were not I ended up having to get a larger robber from the Spa locker room and never did find slippers that fit 2 On our first night in the room the turndown staff showed up at 5pm just after we had returned from the pool We informed the person that we didnt want any turndown service during our stay until 630pm at the earliest At 600 pm  turndown comes to the door again We send them away again At 630 when we are leaving for Mary Poppins they arrive for service We ask them to be sure to leave extra pillows and blankets for the boys on the sofabed We arrive back from the show at 1030 pm to find one pillow and one blanket on the sofabed To their credit within 10 minutes we had the extras we had requested 3 On our second night turndown shows up AGAIN at 5pm and we tell them AGAIN no service earlier than 630pm AGAIN another knock on the door at 6pm We ask them to come back at 630 when we plan to leave and make clear that the extra pillow and blanket we had saved from the previous night is to be used AGAIN We arrive back at the hotel from dinner at 830pm to find one pillow and one blanket on the sofabed AGAIN we must call for additional pillow and blanket 4 On our third and final evening in the hotel we were tired from a day of Lincoln Park Zoo and shopping so we went to our room at 345 to find the housekeeping staff just starting to service the room OK  we decided to go to Rebar for a drink and enjoyed another nice view of the river They served us a small tray of nibbling items including my fave  pitted kalamata olives The sushi menu looked good  and expensive  but we only wanted a drink and the view We returned to our room at 430 and were disappointed to find housekeeping still there This time we remained in our room to ensure that an extra pillow and blanket were delivered and the sofabed was made up And guess what  at 5pm turndown knocked on the door AGAIN This is a fivestar hotel for crying out loud They are supposed to note these kinds of things after being told once I didnt get a chance to register any complaint with the management before we checked out because we had a schedule to keep However I was able to note the issues on the follow up guest survey I received via email the day after checkout Bottom line  we would stay at the Trump again as 95 of the stay was really great You cannot beat the location and with the exception of Housekeeping staff members were responsive and gracious\\t\\n',\n",

night on a special Travelzoo deal I decided to give the Trump a try and indulge a little for a Mothers Day stay with my kids I was impressed from the moment we arrived We valet parked and our bags were brought inside for a smooth check in  every staff member addressed us by name Kids were given backpacks with cotton candy and coloring books Bellman brought us to our room as we got off the elevator I could tell we were headed to the river side of the property I was so surprised amp pleased to see we had been upgraded to a larger partial river view room The room was kind of wedge shaped so the panoramic views from the floor to ceiling windows were amazing Furnishings were in a muted purple with taupes and grays and looked just like the pictures on the website I had ordered some amenities gourmet popcorn candy jar and chocolate covered strawberries ahead of time to surprise my kids and all were in the room just like I had requested A few minutes after we arrived at our room the bellman returned with little stuffed animals pink and blue cows with a Trump Kids logo for each of the kids  told me they had inadvertantly been left out of their backpacks at check in  I was later told that the kids names and ages hadnt been updated into my profile we only booked one day prior I asked about robes and slippers for the kids and housekeeping brought them a few minutes later We opted to relax and order a room service lunch  kids had a burger amp fries and grilled cheese with tomato soup I got prosciutto di parma with buffalo mozzarella on grilled baguette Food was amazing and presented with real silverware and a fresh orchid The server asked if we would be dining at Sixteen later I told him I thought the experience would likely be lost on the kids but he mentioned that anything on the kids room service menu could be ordered at the restaurant  Ill keep this in mind for next time As it stood we kept out reservations at Harry Carays  an easy 2 block walk from the hotel After lunch we checked out the pool You have to sign in at the spa on the 14th floor to use the pool but the staff was very helpful and personally escorted us to the locker rooms Kids enjoyed a nice swim while I relaxed and enjoyed the views of the Chicago River amp Lake Michigan Headed back to our room to get ready for dinner and found housekeeping was already there to turn down the bed They dont leave wrapped chocolates on the pillow rather a lovely glass tray of assorted chocolates and a gumdrop my kids fought over Before swimming we had asked for a game console and we found a Playstation 3 and a few games had been delivered while we were out Kids had a little trouble with the controllers but maintenance came up quickly and brought the connection cable we were missing Kids enjoyed a Walle game while I got ready When we came back from dinner we found the sofa bed had been made up just like we requested at checkin What we did not find were cookies for this kids which I thought were part of the Trump Kids amenities A quick phone call to the front desk and a few minutes later in room dining brought up 2 large chocolate chunk cookies with glasses of milk Kids couldnt even finish them After the kids fell asleep I took a bath  the bathroom is lovely with a TV in the mirror as well as an adjoining tub and shower Tub was deep and long with a waterfall faucet and I was able to indulge and enjoy a long bath  I am 5 10quot and the tub was quite comfortable  this is rare for me The shower has a rainfall head as well as a separate handheld shower massage Robes for adults were in the bathroom and a digital scale and hair dryer were available as well Bath amenities were very ample size  much larger than most hotels Bed was so comfy  I loved the pillows but there was a pillow menu if you wanted something different Kids couldnt wait to wake me up and open the curtains  all controlled with convenient wall switches The view was even more impressive than the day before We ordered room service for breakfast  my breakfast would have served all 3 of us if my kids werent so picky I ordered a quotHeart Healthyquot combination for 27 which included choice of juices from orange to cherry pomegranate a blueberry muffin with assorted jams amp honey a large fruit plate with 4 kinds of berries cantaloupe honeydew pineapple and oranges a huge bowl of Swiss Mueslix with pecan halves slivered almonds chopped apple and dried apricot and coffee tea or skim milk I didnt eat half of it  just so much food Kids pancakes and french toast were 9 each but served with more fresh berries We had time for another swim before checking out and wished we had booked more than one night It was such an enjoyable stay Had a few glitches at check out  our breakfast charges werent on the bill and the website had promised business cards for the kids with their names printed on them We had lunch and shopping planned so we agreed to store our bags and come back later to get the kids cards and my corrected bill Was so pleased to find out the valet would keep our car until 5PM included in the 52 daily rate from when we checked in  we took full advantage I was handed an envelope when we got back  they recognized us I just assumed the envelope had the cards for the kids and my bill but once home found only the cards Im sure they sorted the bill out and if I dont get a copy in the mail Ill give them a call and ask Our stay was not seamless but whenever things didnt go quite right staff went above and beyond to rectify matters and were always apologetic and cordial What I loved most about the Trump was the lack of pretentiousness As far as I could see all the guests were treated well and addressed by name Even bell staff in the elevator greeted us and asked us how we were enjoying our stay I felt like we were being welcomed back rather than staying there for the first time It was really a delightful experience This is what a luxury hotel should be  friendly

Trump three times now The first two times were phenomenal My family and I have always stayed in the 46 type room between the 1923 floors We love the view of the Wrigley Building and the magnificent Chicago lake front and river The rooms were always flawless the service was great and there was not much more that we could ask for Upon arrival our favorite doorman MK greeted us by name said he was so glad that we were back and helped us to check in as usual It was a great start to what should have been a fabulous stay Then things started going downhill first of all we had to wait a good 5 minutes before anyone came to the front desk Where was all the staff One of the male concierges came over and started chatting with us he was charismatic and let us know that if there was anything he could do for us to please let him know Well there is something he could have done he could have either checked us in or got someone to check us in Instead of doing either of those things he went back to his desk and started chatting with one of his coworkers When someone finally did check us in they were very nice She acknowledged that we were return guests and said she was glad that we had come back to stay at Trump Then she gave us our keys I need to stop here for a second The last two times I have stayed at this hotel not only was I not handed my keys I had someone take my family up to the room show us where things were and of course open the door for us As I took the key I didnt think too much of it but after everything that happened during our stay I can now see how our stay was destined for disaster from the get go When we got to our room everything was beautiful as usual our youngest daughter called down to attach to see if she could get an XBOX and they obliged two hours later it wasnt in our room and when we called down to inquire we found out that they had left for the night In previous stays we had always called the attach desk as late as 1100pm with someone there to grant our wishes and now at 900pm no one was there It wasnt even a holiday Before heading out for some shopping my husband and I decided we wanted to stop by the concierge desk to see our favorite concierge Alexzandra To our dismay we found out that she was recently transferred to another property When we did ask the concierge questions the girl either didnt know the answer or was robotic I dont ask that much of a concierge but when I want to go to a fine dining option that isnt as mainstream as Charlie Trotters I expect the concierge to deliver and she did not As a family we heavily rely on a concierge We like to be able to throw out an idea and have the concierge make it happen and on this trip things just werent the same We decided to go to restaurants we had already been to since the two concierges we spoke to could not come up with anything that we hadnt already been to My oldest daughter is a fashion forward 16 year old who loves exploring Chicagos indie neighborhoods Normally the concierge would come up with a detailed plan of attack for her stay but no one seemed interested in providing a level of service that actually required some thought Needless to say we were disappointed and she was boredI think the most disappointing service issue we had was that there was an overall lack of attention given to my family The only person who called my family by name was MK all of the other staff members didnt even make an effort to address us by name No one was particularly rude but at the five star level I want extraordinary and that is what I used to get at the Trump and it is a shame that that is no longer the caseDuring our first two trips to the Trump service seemed to be of the utmost importance to this hotel they had staff everywhere They had great staff Now it seems like they are cutting back on their most valuable asset and forgetting why their customers stay there I dont stay at a hotel to be left alone I stay at a hotel to be pampered I want somebody to open the door for me I want the concierge to know my name and I want to be escorted to my room When I am paying thousands of dollars a night I expect the best and Trump did not deliverMr Trump you have a lot invested in this property I advise you to go and stay there I think you should see what your hard earned money has bought you This hotel is slipping I have quite honestly received better service at Holiday Inns then I did on my last stay at your hotel We used to LOVE your hotel my daughters begged me to bring them back here but after the service lack of we received on our most recent visit we will be going back to the Peninsula as they have continually met our needs without a bat of the eyeI dont want a refund for my stay I want my time back and that is far more valuable than any monetary sum this hotel could refund me\\t\\n',\n",

       " 'Loved the hotel HATED THE RACIST DOORMAN\\tWe recently stayed at the Trump hotel in June I am originally from Chicago and we wanted to visit our family who live further north on Lake Shore Drive We got a river view suite and I think it was about 50000 a nightI have to say the hotel is STUNNING Our initial room was great but noisy there is still ongoing construction The front desk at the Trump obliged in giving us a new room and it was breathtaking Everything is very modern and new and in keeping with the sleek modernity that you would see at hotels like the Mercer in NYCsleek but not overwhelming or intimidating The room had the BEST Chicago viewNavy Pier and the Chicago River and it was mostly unobstructed and endless And a real bonus was that the windows open just a bitwe are sticklers for fresh air That allowed just enough air in without there being a hazard for those of you with small childrenThe room one bedroom apartment was clean and roomy and had everything you could want we had a suite that had two full baths with absolute top of the line fixturesamenities like a television in the mirror I want that for home marble showers AND separate baths There was a full kitchen with top of the line appliances Miele dishwasher for example and also free Nespresso which would be a real bonus for families for childrenSpeaking of children when we notified the hotel that we would have a baby visiting us for the day they immediately put not only a great crib in our room but a high chair a diaper genie and soap and lotion etc for the baby We really appreciated that gestureThe swimming pool is also great for kids and they are very friendly there and will provide swimming noodles and amenities for those with small children Adjacent to the swimming pool btw with a breathtaking view the SpaFitness room is absolutely top of the linebrand new and plentiful equipment Pilates classes and fresh water fruit infused and bottled The last day we were there they replaced the bottled water with Trump Ice water which had a picture of Donald Trump on it We thought it very funny It is so neat to exercise in a great location high up overlooking all of ChicagoThe restaurant however is a work in progress The staff was not yet fully trained the water tasted like chlorine and they kept trying to fill my glass with it even though we had bottled water and the menu was HORRIBLY expensive 5000 for an entree but not inspired We actually had a hard time trying to figure out what to order because nothing sounded interesting enough to pay for Before we were finished it was clear they wanted us to leave and started to fold linens in our vicinity which seems strange when you are paying 40000 for dinner But the view is greatHowever the fact that I liked the hotel as much as I did makes me sad to continue this review and end up only giving this hotel 3 stars The first incident that blew our minds was what will be known in our family as the quotracist doorman incidentquot On the early afternoon of Friday June 20th it began to rain just as my family stopped by to pick us up for lunch Earlier in the day I had gone out and it had rained and I asked for an umbrella at the first counter where the doorpersons are stationed They happily obliged one person was a nice older African American woman with braids I returned the umbrella as we came in and thought nothing of itAt about 1pm however when I asked for two umbrellas we were now a motley group of 4 toddlers and 6 adults without an umbrella amongst us the same woman manning the door attempted to go behind the desk and retrieve them but the man behind the counter looked at us stopped her and said We are all out of umbrellas If you need an umbrella you will have to go up to your room to get one Fair enough We understood that if it was raining umbrellas may be in limited supply My husband went upstairs to get an umbrella But in the meantime the same man behind the counter took out all these new umbrellas and started unwrapping them They were there all alongWhat was more HUMILIATING was that he came from behind the counter and gave an umbrella each to two white women who hadnt even left the lobby and HADNT EVEN ASKED FOR THEM YET I was shocked but I was actually more humiliated Both my 4 year old daughter and my 65 year old mother asked me why the man said there were no more umbrellas when clearly there were How could I tell my daughter there were no more umbrellas for people like us Did he not like us because we were the wrong color or because he didnt think we were worthy of the hotel I have my suspicions but dont you think that was awful At least the African American coworker who was clearly embarrassed then proceeded to go behind the counter and give us all umbrellas But he really ruined my day and I felt really low I thought about why he would do such a thing in front of my family all dayThat same day at 830 I went down to ReBar their signature bar that they tout as serving exotic cocktails for a quick cocktail with my sister I felt we were both dressed well she was in a summer dress and I was in a pucci dress When we sat down a waitress came to us and said quotIm sorry but this table is bottle service only after 900pm My sister responded that it was only 830 The waitress served us but you could tell she wasnt happy about it I can tell you that we looked like everyone else in the bar the bar btw skews middleaged and distinctly suburban I definitely was one of the younger people there My sister who already had the quotumbrellaquot incident started talking about how she felt uncomfortable being there and so as soon as the drink came we took it upstairs But the kicker is that my husband and myself came back an hour and half later and guess what The couple now sitting in the same seats we had earlier occupied was just drinking simple cocktails Where was the bottle service Beats meInitially I was willing to believe that these two incidents were an aberration and that there is no pattern No one wants to accuse a hotel of something like casual racism in this day and age But after speaking with the manager I am not so sure They say all behaviors emanate from the top and if this is the case I have to say the manager could do a better job at dispelling my suspicionsWhen I wrote the manager about this both he T Colm OCallaghan and his assistant manager Jerome tried repeatedly to contact me I assumed that they were contacting me to apologize but what actually ended up happening is that Mr OCallaghan at first apologized and then tried to intimate that I had misread the situation He kept trying to tell me that what happened didnt happen He said they simply ran out of umbrellas HELLO I was there They NEVER ran out of umbrellas the guy just didnt want to give us the umbrellas he had He kept trying to spin it as a misunderstanding but this guy just didnt want to waste his dwindling resources umbrellas on the likes of usAs for the bar incident he said that certain areas have bottle service after a certain hour But when I told him that hour hadnt been reached she didnt want to serve us at 830pm because she said bottle service starts at 9 and when I came back an hour and half later the people now sitting at the same seats were just having cocktails he didnt want to talk about it Weird Instead of diffusing the situation he made me feel as if he didnt want to hear what really happened and that he thought I was a silly deluded personSo in the end this hotel gets 3 stars 5 stars for the hotel amenities spaswimming poolfitness center view and most of the staff and one or none for the racist doorman waitress  and pretty insensitive manager The restaurant was also not so great\\t\\n',\n",

mile from OHaredirectly in the flight path depending on windWhen I arrived I was greeted by the nice staff at the front desk and given a room on the Club Floor Room 1625 Upon entering you are in the living area of the room There was an arm chair 2 little square tables a sofa sofa bed desk chair TV and a miniarmoire that contained a little refrigerator and an inroom safe The Club Lounge would be closed for the weekend so I was given coupons for a free quotfull servicequot breakfast This room faced west toward OHare Something bugged me about the living room but it took a while to figure it out The bedroom featured a kingsized bed another TV and a closet containing an ironboard  clothes steamerrefresher and a robe The bathroom was fairly large with a stall shower no tub that was at least 35 feet x 55 feet with a handheld shower The problems with the shower are that 1 the door opens out so the water gets all over the floor 2 there is no handle on the inside of the door 3 no place to sit to shave your legs ladies and 4 it is kind of dark Plus unless you are about a size 6 the robe wont fit And as the day went on I noticed several other things wrong with the room Honestly I had higher expectations of the Renaissance based partly on the other reviews here and I was let downThe carpet had 3 very large stains on it just inside the door The door itself was difficult to open and close In the corner of the shower there was a lot of mold on the grout between the tiles near the floor Water pressure was minimal water pressure at best the toilet seat was very loose and the AC smelled of mildew all the time Wound up keeping it off most of the day There were crumbs on the floor between the tables and the furniture was really beaten up The table was cracking and the desk had big gouges on it and on the legs For a Club Level room the place was really not up to Marriott standards At this point I finally realized what I disliked about the living area The way it was set up made me feel like I was sitting in someones office Hard to explain but I was really not comfortableThe bed part of Marriotts new bedding package was fairly comfortable but neither the feather bed on top of the mattress nor the comforter were very fluffy and full These both need to be washed and fluffed Honestly I have had regular blankets that are thicker Yes it is getting warm out but I like to have a cold room and then a nice fluffy down quiltI gave the front desk the list of problems with the room I really hate moving rooms but the gal insisted that I go eat breakfast and stop back for a new room Breakfast was another story The coupon said quotfull servicequot meaning I should be able to order off the menu Well I was told I had to get the buffet It wasnt bad Actually my omelet was cooked in real melted butter and it was very good But my server did not ask me if I wanted toast or an English muffin there was no toaster as is standard for Marriotts nor did he get me Orange juice I did get a little shot of strawberry smoothie which was goodThe buffet had eggs bacon cold and soggy sausage fruit cereals oatmeal and cream of wheat breakfast potatoes with peppers and onions of courseyuck and some muffins and coffee cake The coffee cakes really looked to be of the Entenmanns or Sara Lee variety like you get in a grocery store Why They had those telltale aluminum foil cake pan marks on the side Eh The chef was very nice the server was just OKReturned to the desk and was moved to room 1630 which is one of the corner suites Looks just like the photos on the Marriott website except there are no drapes just 2 types of shadesa sheer and a blackout shade The sheer shade in the bedroom would not go up This room was very large The living area was the size of a large hotel room itself Closet TV diningroom table with 6 chairs a stereo and lots of speakers I guess you could use it for some sort of surround sound but I am not so inclined desk couch and arm chair Its funny though there is no lamp close to the sofa for reading There is a big ceiling lamp over the dining table and a desk lamp but nothing close enough to sit and read at night Hmm At the risk of sounding mean Marriott needs some women designing their hotels Or at least people with common sense who actually USE their hotelsThe bedroom had a king bed TV another closet and some drawers The alarm clock even has directions The bathroom here had an actual tub with the hand held shower And on the inside of one of the doors a lovely dirty kids handprint Great This is supposed to be an even better room and the housekeeper doesnt check the inside of the doors Details people The robe in this room was thick fluffy and of a size that would fit most normalsized humans At least this room didnt have that mildew smell from the AC The view was nice You can see the Chicago skyline in the distance And you get to see the highway and the El The hotel is very noisy Not so much from other guests but the trains cars and planes can get on your nerves I can live with airplane noise but if you are a light sleeper ear plugs are a MUSTThe quotwired for businessquot package for internet and local and long distance domestic calls is 995 per day which isnt bad Parking is 20 per day Food prices were a bit high for dinner Some of the drink prices in the bar were reasonable They had some featured drinks that were 700 and considering the amount and types of liquor in them this was a reasonable price One had Patron tequila for which another Marriott charged 10 a shot This stuff is super expensiveThere is a Bennigans across the parking lot and the hotel is a very short walk to the Blue Line trains Cumberland station You can purchase visitors passes at the Cumberland station They are in a different machine than the regular trainbus tickets For 5 you can get unlimited rides on the El CTA and PACE buses Also you can get either a 2 3 or 7 day pass for 9 12 and 20 respectively These passes are a great deal considering it is 4 round trip to Chicago And if you ride the bus a couple times in a day your pass will more than pay for itself You can also get these passes at OHare Union Station and a couple other places The hotel does have a free shuttle to the airport Never had to wait longer than about 10 minutes Overall the hotel staff was very nice and it is a lovely property However it needs to be cleaner with respect to both rooms and public areas For instance there was quotstuffquot on the rug outside the elevator on the 16th floor for over 48 hours This should have been vacuumed up Breakfast on subsequent days was better although it took until the final day for the server to ask if I wanted toast I met the restaurant manager and spoke with him at length about my issues He actually gave me a coupon for a complimentary appetizer in the bar since the Club Lounge was closed I had steak quesadillas that were very good The bar was empty save for one other couple Service was friendly but less than attentive Wound up leaving due to the foul language being used by both the woman and man sitting down the bar I will skip the lecture about not using filthy language in public Please show some class There was a billing error at checkout I was charged for too many nights I had a coupon for a free night and I was charged for internet service for two days which was only used once The person at the desk seemed a bit annoyed that she had to fix it for me Perhaps it was just too early I would say that 98 of the staff was wonderful There are just a couple people who need some extra training in customer serviceWith a good rate I may consider returning but there are other hotels that I think are in better shape than this Renaissance This is supposed to be a more upscale brand than a regular full service Marriott In my opinion the rooms are a little too cold and stark I guess this is the new trend but it makes this place seem too much like an officequot and less like a hotel Yes it is geared to business travelers but there is a fine line between office and a hotel room with space to work To me this place is an office that happens to have a bed It wasnt horrible just not the best Again this is just my opinion Different strokes for different folks Most people love it I didnt\\t\\n',\n",
